"Second, with a further assumed real effective depreciation of the US dollar of about 7 per cent over the projection horizon, and a strengthening in global investment which raises demand for US capital goods, the growth in US exports is projected to accelerate.",pos
The weakening of the narrow aggregates and of a number of components of M2++ has contributed to a pronounced decline in the growth rate of M2++.,neg
"In summary, on the basis of a growth rate of GDP in the middle of the range of 2.75 to 3.75 per cent and assuming that the Bank's estimates of the output gap are broadly correct, core inflation should rise gradually over the course of the next 18 months but remain in the lower half of the target range.",neutral
"GDP growth should average about 4 per cent over 2017-19, supported by ongoing recoveries in countries previously in recession and progress on growth-enhancing reforms.",pos

"In addition, rising house prices and financial innovation continue to bolster consumer borrowing secured by home equity, either through mortgage refinancing or through home-equity lines of credit.",pos
"The forecast for real GDP growth in 2017 has been revised up following stronger-than-anticipated household expenditures, particularly residential investment, as well as stronger-than-expected spending activity in the oil and gas sector.",pos
"The Bank continues to project that the expansion will be driven mainly by growth in consumption and business investment, reflecting very stimulative domestic financial conditions.",pos
"This is consistent with the portfolio shifts mentioned earlier, since the strong growth that was seen in the transactions components of M2++ has been offset by declines in savings instruments such as term deposits and Canada Savings Bonds.",neutral

Core CPI inflation has come down faster than was projected in either the April Report or the July Update.,neg
Canadian households reduced their spending by more than anticipated in response to the decline in their net worth and an elevated level of economic uncertainty.,neg
"At the same time, total CPI inflation (excluding the effect of changes in indirect taxes) is projected to be more subdued than in April and to remain somewhat below 2 per cent, mainly because of lower expected energy prices.",neg
"Consumer price inflation in China stood at 3.6 per cent in March 2012, well below its recent peak of 6.5 per cent in July 2011, owing in large part to rapidly moderating food price inflation.",neg

"In the core economies, activity has picked up noticeably, led by strength in exports.",pos
"The Canadian dollar has recently been trading above 68 cents US, reaching a three-year high.",neutral
High levels of narrow money growth have traditionally implied higher future inflation.,pos
"The Bank's projection assumes real GDP growth of 2.5 per cent, at an annual rate, during the first half of 2005.",neutral
Both core inflation and total CPI inflation (excluding the impact of the sales tax harmonization in Ontario and British Columbia) are expected to be close to the 2 per cent target throughout the projection horizon.,neutral

"On balance, the prices of non-energy commodities are expected to ease over the projection period from their current very high levels.",neg
"Since then, many currencies, including the Canadian dollar, have traded in fairly wide but more stable ranges.",neutral

"As a result, the year-over-year rise in unit labour costs remained very low.",neg
The recovery is expected to be more gradual than usual.,neg
"This suggests a resumption of economic expansion in the second half of 1995, even allowing for a possible upward bias in M1 growth coming from particular factors affecting the corporate-demand-deposits component.",pos

"These factors, together with supply cuts by OPEC, have also helped boost world oil prices.",pos
"While the Bank expects a significant pickup in US growth in the second half of 2001 and some further strengthening in 2002, the abruptness and extent of the slowdown highlight the downside risk that the rebound in aggregate demand in the United States may take longer to take hold.",neg
Measures undertaken by the authorities to cool activity in the real estate sector have led to a softening in housing demand and a fall in property prices.,neg
Total exports are projected to increase at a moderately stronger pace than expected in the October Report.,pos
The downward revision was driven by three main factors.,neg
"The reduction in bank funding costs has, to a significant extent, been passed on to households.",pos

"For example, the structural estimate of the labour input gap is currently around -1 1/2 per cent.",neutral
Real GDP growth is projected to gather some momentum in 2013 as the benefits from the reforms put in place to address the debt crisis begin to materialize and confidence gradually improves.,pos
"When assessing excess capacity, the Bank considers its conventional measure in conjunction with several other indicators, since there is considerable uncertainty surrounding estimates of potential output, particularly when the economy is coming out of a deep recession.",neutral
Lower energy prices have led to a downward revision of the projection for total consumer price inflation.,neg
"For the second half of the year as a whole, exports were markedly weaker than projected, although this was partly offset by unexpectedly large inventory investment.",neg
