1,"Exports of a wide range of Canadian goods are expected to benefit, including aircraft, medium and heavy trucks, and specialized machinery and equipment."
0,"Additionally, the rate of change in core food prices has eased markedly, owing to such factors as increased competition in the retail food sector."

0,"Following their sharp slide in the second half of 2014, the benchmark oil prices that are relevant for the Canadian economy have been quite volatile, fluctuating at or below levels assumed in the January Report."
1,"As a result, the growth outlook for 2017 is now above 2 per cent."
1,"This is in part because the price increases in the sectors responsible for the pickup are currently above their historical averages and tend to exhibit low inflation persistence, suggesting that they will subside quickly going forward."
0,"In this context, the lack of agreement on a production quota by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) at its December meeting triggered further price declines, and it now looks less likely that additional Iranian oil supply will be offset by reductions from other OPEC members."
0,"However, the rate of increase in real GDP is expected to ease as a result of the international economic slowdown and the fallout from financial market nervousness."
0,"On balance, the full range of indicators suggests that the Bank's conventional measure of capacity output has underestimated the amount of capacity in the Canadian economy."
1,"If gasoline prices were to remain elevated relative to oil prices, total CPI inflation would also be higher than in the base case."
0,"Estimates of losses from exposure to U.S. mortgage and structured credits have increased, and problems in these markets have spread to other credit markets."
0,"After experiencing a considerable buildup of stocks early this year, retailers and wholesalers slashed their rates of inventory accumulation in the second quarter."
0,The downward pressures on import prices arising from declining world prices for many goods and from a rising Canadian dollar were also stronger than expected.
1,Firms surveyed for the Bank's latest Business Outlook Survey point to improvements in the U.S. economic outlook and foreign orders and to the benefits of their recent investments in bolstering their ability to export.
1,These assumptions are that there will be no further major escalation of terrorism and that confidence will recover to normal levels in the second half of 2002.
0,"Sales of existing homes have fallen, partly because of measures taken by federal authorities."
0,"It is unclear, for example, whether the large fiscal and current account imbalances in many major economies will be resolved in a way that maintains growth."
0,"Estimates from the Bank's two measures of the output gap (the structural and statistical approaches) point to a notable widening during the first half of 2015, which is persisting in the second half."
0,"On the one hand, the adverse developments in Asia, particularly in Japan, were increasingly weighing on the Canadian economy."
0,"GDP growth is projected to be around 1 1/2 per cent in 2018, and to moderate significantly by 2020 in the wake of a planned 2019 hike in the value-added tax."
1,The projection for economic activity through 2016 and 2017 has been revised up.
1,"Household spending is also projected to grow at a healthy rate, although the pace of expansion will be moderated somewhat by the withdrawal of monetary stimulus."
0,"However, the factors at work also suggest that slack in the economy will not be taken up in any significant way until the second half of the year."
1,"During the past six months, the Canadian economy has continued to expand briskly, outstripping expectations."
1,The early summer peak in yields reflected both the perceived beginning of the tightening phase in the U.S. interest rate cycle and growing optimism about the strength of the U.S. and global recoveries.
1,"U.S. financial conditions nevertheless remain supportive of growth, with corporate credit yields near record-low levels despite the rise in Treasuries."
1,"The increased demand was again concentrated in components such as machinery and equipment and consumer purchases of motor vehicles, most of which tend to be imported."
0,"However, weak growth in both hours worked and wages, together with no improvement in the Bank's labour market indicator over the past year, suggests that the workforce remains underutilized."
0,"Nonetheless, low oil prices in comparison with mid-2014 will result in a persistently softer level of activity in oil-exporting economies."
0,"Global economic uncertainty remains important, however, especially over the near term."
1,Sectoral analysis also suggests that conditions for investment in the non-resource sector have generally improved since 2014.
0,A notable increase in global protectionism remains the most important source of uncertainty facing the Canadian economy.
0,"Growth in 2011, however, is now projected to be somewhat weaker."
0,"By itself, this drop would reduce overall business investment by about 10 per cent."
1,"In addition, if producers are able to find further cost savings or if US oil firms take advantage of the recent firming in prices to hedge future production, the rebalancing of the market may be more protracted than expected."
1,"The output gap is now expected to close in the first half of 2018, somewhat sooner than projected in January."
0,"Domestic demand is not expected to become a significant driver of economic growth until late 2014, when the negative effects of tight lending conditions and fiscal consolidation begin to dissipate."
1,"This implies that the economy would be in slight excess demand in 2006, before returning to potential output by the end of the projection period."
0,"Construction activity in the United States has remained weak, and house prices have fallen further."
1,"Periodicals > SLOS 2011Q1), greater competition among lending institutions, and from capital markets, together with a more favourable economic outlook, has led to a further loosening of lending conditions for a wider range of borrowers."
0,"Overall, the Bank judges that the amount of excess capacity remained material in the fourth quarter of 2015, between 3/4 and 1 3/4 per cent."
1,"The recent depreciation of the Canadian dollar, which has reversed a small part of the earlier deterioration in Canada's competitiveness, should help to promote stronger growth in exports."
0,There continued to be a substantial amount of excess supply in the Canadian economy in the third quarter.
1,"Economic activity picked up significantly in the second half of 1996, broadly in line with expectations."
0,"Chinese authorities have implemented measures to restrain aggregate demand and price increases, although further actions are assumed."
0,Their efforts to contain these pressures are being complicated in some cases by a lack of exchange rate flexibility.
0,"Underlying inflationary pressures remain subdued in light of persistent excess capacity, particularly in the labour markets of a number of advanced economies, where wage growth remains weak."
1,Temporary tax reductions that were announced late last year will also provide a significant boost to consumption in 2011.
1,"For many exporters, the lower exchange rate has boosted margins and cash flow expressed in Canadian dollars."
1,This effect is expected to be offset by the gradual absorption of excess supply.
1,"Gains in non-resource employment have averaged almost 20,000 jobs per month since the beginning of the year."
0,"Global output is now projected to fall by 0.8 per cent in 2009, and to increase by a more modest 2.2 per cent in 2010 - well below the rate of growth of global potential output."
1,"As well, the ongoing strength in the US labour market and the creation of new businesses may draw discouraged workers back into the labour force."
1,"Over the second half of 1997, the underlying momentum of the economy remained robust."
1,"This projection implies that the estimated margin of unused capacity would be absorbed during this period, with growth at the upper end of the range moving the economy towards its production capacity at a faster rate."
0,Recent monthly data on goods exports have disappointed.
0,"On the downside, global private demand around the world, including in the United States, may be insufficient to sustain the recovery."
0,"The quarterly variability is exacerbated by the economic effects of the devastating wildfires in Alberta, which are estimated to have subtracted about 1 percentage point from GDP growth in the second quarter."
0,The insufficient capacity is exacerbated by major refinery outages on the U.S. west coast and in the Midwest.
0,"The expected deceleration of the U.S. economy, in addition to reduced stimulus from the earlier depreciation of the Canadian dollar, should begin to ease export growth some time this year."
0,These measures leave the level of real GDP 0.3 per cent lower at the end of 2018.
1,"Unlike the situation in most other advanced economies, Canadian consumers can readily obtain credit, as evidenced by the continued brisk pace in its growth."
1,"Final domestic demand also rose considerably, especially at the beginning of the year."
1,"Analysis suggests that incorporating these new measures, as well as the recent measures introduced at the provincial level, into the projection results in a contribution to GDP growth of government spending of 0.5 percentage points in 2016 and 0.6 percentage points in 2017."

0,"The broad forces of household, bank and sovereign deleveraging will continue to restrain growth in many advanced economies."
0,These policy actions came in response to weak current and expected domestic activity and the consequent downward pressures on future inflation.
1,All measures of wages have picked up in recent months and are now more consistent with other indicators of tightness in labour markets.
0,"Growth in the euro-area economy will likely remain anemic, owing to high debt levels, tight credit conditions and weak labour markets."
1,"The outlook for growth in the major advanced countries in 2009 and 2010 remains broadly unchanged from the April Report, but the risk of a sustained economic decline has diminished considerably."
0,This growth projection for 2005 is also lower than the latest Consensus outlook.
1,"Imports continued to show strong growth in the last six months of 1999 and in early 2000, mainly reflecting the rapid advance in domestic demand for import-intensive items such as machinery and equipment and motor vehicles."

1,The Bank now projects that economic expansion in both the United States and Canada will begin to strengthen towards the end of this year and will be above the growth of potential output during 2004.
1,"At this pace, capacity pressures will intensify."
1,The surge in world energy prices improved Canada's terms of trade (the price of exports relative to the price of imports) considerably in the second half of 2005.
1,"Further economic growth abroad, especially in the United States, should lead to increased demand for Canadian exports."
0,"Although Canada has limited direct trade and financial exposure to Europe, if a euro-area country or large bank were to lose access to debt markets, leading to a sudden loss of confidence, financial contagion to the United States could cause U.S. credit spreads to widen and equity prices to fall."
1,Others may choose instead to increase their spending on goods and services.
0,"With positive revisions to potential output and a lower-than-expected level of GDP, the Bank judges that the output gap in the first quarter of 2018 was between -0.75 and +0.25 per cent."

0,China's GDP growth is expected to slow from 6.9 per cent in 2015 to 6.3 per cent in 2018 - a decline that is somewhat more gradual than anticipated in the January Report.
0,"However, recent developments have led firms in the energy sector to further reduce their expectations for oil prices over the near to medium term."
1,The gains in net trade resulting from the depreciation of the euro and the yen should provide some offset to the lingering headwinds in these regions.
0,"However, there has been significant market differentiation among EMEs: those with weaker economic fundamentals, such as large fiscal and current account deficits, high inflation and declining growth prospects, have been the most affected."
1,"Capacity utilization in many non-energy industries has also increased in recent quarters, a precursor to greater investment spending."
1,"In Canada, the economic recovery is proceeding somewhat more rapidly than the Bank had projected in January and the profile for growth is more front-loaded."
1,"Income gains from lower gasoline prices are being used either to boost current spending or to repay debt or increase savings, thus improving consumers' ability to spend in future years."
0,September's terrorist attacks and their aftermath have had a further significant negative impact on the U.S. economy.
1,"Together with services exports, several goods components, such as aircraft and related parts and pharmaceutical and medicinal products, are expected to lead the recovery in non-commodity exports."
0,"In the United States, the anticipated fiscal consolidation should lead to increased national savings, but the negative effect of higher oil prices on the terms of trade is expected to delay the improvement in the current account balance."
1,New fiscal stimulus measures are also being implemented in a number of countries.
1,The results of the Spring 2015 Trade Confidence Index survey conducted by Export Development Canada provide corroborating evidence that the positive effects of the lower dollar for Canadian exporters are becoming more evident.
1,This is expected to have a positive impact on Canada's terms of trade.
1,"To reinforce its conditional commitment to maintain the overnight rate at 1/4 per cent, the Bank will roll over a portion of its existing stock of 1 - and 3-month term purchase and resale agreements (PRAs) into 6 - and 12-month terms at minimum and maximum bid rates that correspond to the target rate and the Bank rate, respectively."
1,"Profits have risen sharply, particularly in the resource and manufacturing sectors."
0,The downward pressure on prices principally reflects a significant amount of excess supply in the economy and heightened competition in the retail sector.
0,The Bank's conventional measure of the output gap suggests that the economy was operating 3.7 per cent below its production potential in the fourth quarter of 2009.
1,"While these increases have been consistent with expectations at the time of the April Report, price developments for many services have been slightly firmer than expected, although wage growth has remained modest."
0,"The 12-month rate of change in total CPI troughed at -0.9 per cent in the quarter, as a result of large year-over-year declines in energy prices."
0,The pace of business investment is projected to moderate in 2001.
0,The lower rate of growth projected for the first half of 2005 stems mainly from the anticipated slowing in the rate of inventory accumulation.
0,"Excess supply in the economy, together with moderate growth in labour compensation and dissipating pressures from commodity prices, is anticipated to result in a moderation in both total and core CPI inflation to below 2 per cent around mid-2012."
0,"Correlations among global asset price movements, together with diminished liquidity in some markets, may make asset prices and capital flows susceptible to sharp movements should new economic data be disappointing."
1,The economy would then continue to operate at about full capacity through to the end of 2008.
1,The continued slowing in household credit growth and the rise in mortgage interest rates point to a gradual unwinding of household imbalances.
1,"Over the projection horizon, exports are forecast to grow by a modest 2.5 per cent, led by strengthening global demand."
1,The main upside risks to inflation are that domestic and international developments will generate more demand for Canadian goods and services than is currently anticipated.
1,"Total CPI inflation is also projected to decline in the near term to close to 2 per cent, in part reflecting lower core inflation, and to remain around the target over the balance of the projection horizon."
0,"At this time, the key issue in the conduct of monetary policy in Canada is the extent of the current slowdown in the pace of economic activity stemming primarily from developments in the United States."
0,This was less than anticipated in both the last Report and the January Update.
0,"Since the July Update, the outlook for the U.S. economy has weakened because of greater-than-expected slowing in the housing sector."
1,"However, some non-energy commodity firms face more-favourable conditions."
0,"Final domestic demand is expected to contract until the third quarter of 2009, owing to persistent weakness in private domestic demand."
0,"Overall, the U.S. economy is expected to grow by around 1 1/2 per cent this year, before strengthening to around 3 per cent in 2015 and 2016, a lower rate of growth than anticipated at the time of the April Report."
1,"In addition, the Bank's summer Business Outlook Survey (available on the Bank's website under Publications and Research > Periodicals > BOS Summer 2011) finds that the proportion of firms indicating that they would have difficulty responding to an unexpected increase in demand has risen above its historical average."
1,"Canada's exports have rebounded, reflecting renewed economic growth in the United States since the last quarter of 2001."
0,"At the same time, growth in final domestic demand in Canada has weakened over the past year."
1,The continued strength in commodity prices since the January Update has reflected the robust global economy.
1,"In contrast, business investment has increased, but by less than expected, despite strong corporate balance sheets."
0,"Overall, growth should slow to around 1 per cent over 2018-19, reflecting demographics and other structural factors, and a sluggish pace of nominal wage increases."
0,"This projected fiscal drag includes the winding down of stimulus programs introduced during the recession, the expiration of payroll tax reductions at the end of 2012 and sequestration cuts starting in 2013."
1,"The latest crude oil futures curve, however, suggests that prices will be higher than previously anticipated."
1,"Near-term housing activity elsewhere is expected to remain high, supported by very low mortgage rates, although the extent to which the downturn already evident in Alberta will spill over into other regions remains to be seen."
1,Strong money growth over this period is largely due to the easing in monetary conditions.
0,Growth in net exports is expected to slow over the projection period in response to an appreciation of the Chinese real effective exchange rate.
0,"The drag from previous tax increases and spending cuts is expected to amount to 1.8 percentage points in 2013, and then to decline to 0.8 percentage points in 2014 and zero in 2015."
1,"The strength of demand in China helped raise the prices of base metals, while both livestock and pulp prices have recovered in the face of reduced supplies."
0,The loss of income and wealth associated with the deterioration in the terms of trade will have a dampening effect on spending.
1,"On balance, after several years of strong growth, business fixed investment showed little change over this period."
0,"Wage growth has also continued to be moderate, consistent with the persistence of slack in the labour market."
1,"Moreover, recent data from the Bank's autumn Business Outlook Survey, which show that the indicators of labour shortages and capacity pressures have increased, are consistent with a gap near the lower end of this range."
1,"For example, greater-than-anticipated foreign demand for Canadian exports could translate into increased business investment and net firm creation, which could result in higher productivity and potential output."
0,"As a result, a broader range of goods and services will be taxed in Ontario and British Columbia."
1,The very substantial increases in both full-time jobs and hiring by firms (as opposed to self-employment) have kept consumer confidence high.
0,"Nevertheless, firms directly or indirectly exposed to the energy sector reported a tightening in credit conditions."
1,The Bank continues to expect moderate economic growth through 2011 and 2012.
0,"In this context, persistent productivity underperformance and stronger relative wage gains in Canada have been working to gradually erode the competitiveness of Canadian exports, despite the depreciation of the Canadian dollar in recent years."
0,"However, the softness in exports in the third quarter was also attributable to such temporary factors as the idling of oil pipelines."
0,The General Motors strike in October led to a temporary decrease in automotive export volumes - and output - in the fourth quarter of 1996.
1,"Nonetheless, the Bank continues to expect modest growth in exports over the projection horizon, owing to the upward trajectory of U.S. activity, the composition of which is still projected to shift in a relatively favourable manner for Canadian exporters."
1,"Aggregate demand, output, and employment grew more rapidly than expected, while core inflation remained low, below projected levels."
0,"Overall, growth in consumption is expected to ease as growth in disposable income gradually slows, partly as the effect of the introduction of the Canada Child Benefit fades."
1,"Available information suggests that real GDP growth for the first quarter of 2001 will be in a range of 1.25 to 2.25 per cent, with robust gains in final domestic demand partly offset by sluggish exports and further reductions in inventory investment."
0,"The Japanese economy is still fragile, however: the financial sector requires further restructuring, and household spending remains weak."
1,"The overall improvement reflected a recovery in the terms of trade, chiefly because of rising commodity prices."
1,"In this context, the Canadian economy is forecast to operate with somewhat less slack throughout the projection horizon than indicated in the January base-case scenario, largely reflecting the slightly higher level of economic activity seen recently."
0,"Weak labour market conditions continue to restrain household income, with the level of employment still 4.5 million below its previous peak."
0,The combination of healthy corporate profits and some delay by businesses in carrying out their investment plans in the face of economic and geopolitical uncertainty has resulted in very slow growth in the demand for total non-financial business credit over the past few months.
1,"Indeed, the Bank's outlook for growth through 2002 and 2003, combined with the unexpected strength of real GDP at the end of last year, implies that the amount of economic slack should be absorbed faster than was anticipated at the time of the last Report."
1,"In Southeast Asia, financial markets have stabilized, progress is being made on structural reforms, and prospects are good for a gradual recovery through this year and next."
0,Global growth prospects have weakened since April.
1,"Because the boost to Canadian exports from the anticipated continuing recovery in the U.S. economy will be dampened by the earlier appreciation of the Canadian dollar, much of the growth in aggregate demand will have to come from domestic sources."
0,"As noted earlier, total CPI inflation has fallen much more rapidly than the core rate, to -0.9 per cent in the third quarter of 2009, reflecting large year-over-year drops in energy prices."
0,"Sales of existing homes and new motor vehicles in these provinces are down by more than 15 per cent since last November, in contrast to modest increases at the national level."
1,Volatility in these markets has remained low.
0,"Given the magnitude and pace of the commodity price decline and the complexity and protracted nature of the adjustment process - with important structural and cyclical implications - there is particular uncertainty about the recovery in aggregate demand and economic activity, the level and evolution of potential output, and thus the timing of the economy's return to full potential."
1,"While strong actions taken by governments and central banks to support financial institutions have led to some retracement in these spreads, it is expected that spreads will be reduced only slowly as confidence is gradually rebuilt."
0,"The slowdown in the demand for import-intensive items, such as machinery and equipment and motor vehicles, contributed to a pronounced reduction in the growth of import volumes."
0,"Euro-area GDP growth in 2013 and 2014 has therefore been revised down to -0.3 per cent and 0.8 per cent, respectively."
0,Weaker exports would have negative implications for business investment since firms would hold back on expanding domestic capacity.
1,"Strong growth in the global demand for oil, together with only modest increases in world production, has resulted in sharply higher oil prices."
1,"The year-over-year increase in the average hourly wage (excluding overtime) for permanent workers, a relatively new addition to Statistics Canada's Labour Force Information, has shown a moderately accelerating trend since late 1998."
1,"This rise in consumer spending, combined with positive indicators of activity in the housing sector and non-residential construction, suggest a notable rebound in growth in the second quarter."
0,The outlook for the euro area is clouded by weak domestic demand.
1,Short-term inflation expectations have been steady in recent months.
1,Canada's economic growth in the first half of 2004 was higher than projected in the April Report.
0,Uncertainty surrounding the global outlook is an important risk for inflation in Canada.
1,"Residential investment is also expected to benefit from these factors, together with a rise in household formation and a gradual easing in credit standards as the competition for new mortgage lending intensifies."
0,"In the United States, economic growth is expected to remain below potential in 2009 and 2010, causing unemployment to continue to rise."
1,"The Bank's action in May, which followed a similar move by the U.S. Federal Reserve, was prompted by concerns about future pressure on capacity limits arising from strong international and domestic demand for Canadian products."
1,"As consumers increasingly perceive the decline in gasoline prices to be durable, they are more likely to increase their spending."
0,"Over the projection horizon, regional divergences in housing activity are expected to gradually fade and the contribution to real GDP growth from residential investment will decline."
1,"In Japan, inventory adjustments have been unexpectedly rapid, suggesting that the inventory cycle will exert less drag on output in the near term."
0,The main risk to this outlook for the Canadian economy is the possibility that the U.S. slowdown could be more protracted than anticipated.
0,"Despite recent improvements in the labour market, the level of employment is far below its previous peak, and long-term joblessness is at historically high levels."
0,The disasters that struck Japan in March will severely affect its economic activity in the first half of this year and create short-­term disruptions to supply chains in advanced economies.
1,Prices should begin to recover later on as the global economy gains strength.
0,There is also uncertainty about the sustainability of U.S. growth beyond mid-2004.
1,"In addition, and perhaps most importantly, the U.S. economy has continued to outperform expectations."
1,Lower oil prices act as a tax cut for consumers and firms by reducing the prices of transportation and other petroleum-related goods and services.
0,"As expected, total consumer price inflation has fallen sharply around the world since mid-2008, reflecting the sizable decline in oil and other commodity prices through early 2009."
1,"The contribution from public investment was also lower in the second quarter; growth in this sector remained strong, however, owing to reconstruction efforts following the natural disasters of March 2011."
1,"With the strong recovery in the first quarter of 2002, the amount of price discounting diminished appreciably."
1,"With economic activity firming, current levels of futures contracts indicate that financial market participants expect the Federal Reserve and the Bank to raise their respective target rates in coming months."
1,Real GDP growth in China remained strong at around 10 per cent in the second and third quarters.
1,"In this base-case projection, accommodative monetary policy, including some further monetary stimulus in 2008, a gradual recovery in the U.S. economy, and the eventual return to more normal credit conditions globally and in Canada, all help to bring aggregate demand back into balance with aggregate supply around mid-2010."
1,"The recovery will be supported by rising world demand, the ECB's recently announced policies, a relatively weak currency and ongoing structural reforms."
0,"The recovery in other industrial economies will be more delayed and more gradual than in the united states, owing to the less-ambitious policy actions undertaken so far and to ongoing difficulties in their banking systems."
1,"Commodity prices have surged since the autumn in response to strong demand, especially from emerging Asia, and have been boosted further more recently by a series of supply disruptions and geopolitical events."
0,The euro area is in recession.
1,U.S. economic activity strengthened through 2014.
0,"Nonetheless, the lower value of the U.S. dollar is expected to hold back the growth of Canada's exports and boost imports."
0,"Early in the year, with core inflation below target and excess supply in the economy, the Bank lowered its target for the overnight interest rate to 2 per cent to support growth in domestic demand."
0,"The profile for government spending is lower than in the January Report, reflecting spending plans announced in recent budgets at all levels of government, as well as the latest information provided by the National Accounts."
1,"This exceptional strength reflected robust growth in consumer spending, underpinned by favourable financial conditions and rising household employment and income."
1,"Over the past year, exports of services, driven by transportation services and travel services, have outperformed goods exports, and strong growth is projected to continue."
1,"But with robust domestic demand, some sectors - such as retail, wholesale, and housing - have been growing strongly."
1,"The Canadian economic recovery is expected to evolve largely as anticipated in the October Report, with the economy returning to full capacity in the third quarter of 2011."
0,The most recent data also show that the level of real GDP was 0 .1 per cent weaker than expected in the fourth quarter of 2017 .
1,"Notably, year-over-year growth in the number of manufacturing firms turned positive in first quarter of 2015 for the first time since 2008."
1,"Canada's real GDP advanced at an annual rate of 3.7 per cent in the first half of 2004, higher than that projected in the last Report."
1,"The effects of these factors appear to have largely dissipated, as suggested by the uptick in inflation in the euro area and Japan in recent months."
1,Natural gas prices are also up a little relative to January.
0,"Important structural reforms, which are necessary to expand potential growth, could also be delayed."
0,Residential investment is therefore projected to decline from the current historically high levels toward a more sustainable position.
1,"As well, the economic expansion in Japan appears to be building momentum."
0,"This growth profile is broadly in line with expectations at the time of the last Report, but nevertheless implies a lower GDP track than previously anticipated."
0,"With firms currently waiting to see a sustained increase in demand before committing to investment plans, investment intentions remain relatively subdued, even though indicators of business sentiment are close to their historical averages."
1,"Global economic growth is expected to be 2.9 per cent in 2014, picking up to 3.6 per cent in 2015 and 3.7 per cent in 2016."
0,The substantial jump in energy prices moved the rate of increase in the total CPI sharply higher to the upper end of the target range.
1,"In addition, there may be some upside risks to the trend rate of growth of labour inputs, at least over the near term."
0,"The slowing evident in the second quarter is projected to continue through the second half of this year, with GDP growth likely to be in the range of 2 to 2.5 per cent at annual rates - below the level of potential growth of the economy, which is now estimated at about 3.0 per cent."
1,These actions were taken to reduce the risk of rising inflation because demand had grown at a surprisingly rapid pace and the markets for many goods and services were already very tight.
1,Fiscal stimulus is expected to be focused on additional infrastructure spending and tax relief for businesses.
1,Non-commodity exports will also be supported by continued growth in foreign demand.
1,"To the extent that credit spreads remain low, firms should continue to have ready access to funding for investment."
0,"It is possible that markets have overreacted to slower growth in China, perceiving recent data as indicative of substantially weaker activity and commodity demand."
0,"Low rates of return on other assets, such as term deposits and GICs, have reduced the opportunity cost of holding liquid balances and have therefore contributed to very strong growth in the narrow money aggregates."
1,"The Chinese economy continues to rebalance toward a more sustainable growth path, broadly in line with the expectations set out in the October Report."
0,U.S. households could reduce their demand for housing and motor vehicles and attempt to rebuild savings more quickly than projected.
1,Financial markets also continue to have a healthy appetite for the security offerings of Canadian corporations.
1,"To support a rebound in the growth of aggregate demand in the second half of this year and in 2002, the Bank of Canada lowered its Bank Rate by 25 basis points on the 23 January announcement date, by 50 basis points on 6 March, and by 25 basis points on 17 April."
0,"By the end of the year, the output gap would widen by roughly an additional 1/4 percentage point."
1,Economic growth is expected to become more solidly entrenched over the projection period as self-sustaining growth in private demand takes hold.
0,"While almost all indicators that the Bank monitors continue to point to excess capacity, they differ widely in the signals they provide on the magnitude of current slack."
1,"China and the other Asian newly industrialized economies continue to expand rapidly, and will continue to do so over the next few years."
1,"The anticipated improvement in global economic growth, particularly in U.S. business and residential investment, is expected to lift Canadian exports over the projection horizon."
1,The Bank expects core inflation to remain around 2 per cent over the projection horizon as excess supply in the economy is slowly absorbed and inflation expectations remain well anchored.
1,Year-over-year growth in gross M1 was about 17 per cent in September.
0,"A sharp depreciation of the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar, as part of a broader currency adjustment, would further exacerbate the negative impact on the demand for Canadian-produced goods."
1,"In our view, the economy would have significant momentum well beyond this year, sustained by the significant amount of monetary easing that has already taken place."
0,"While the supply-chain disruptions resulting from the recent disasters in Japan are leading to volatility in the near-term profile of activity, the broader outlook is little changed, with the Bank continuing to project a moderate pace of growth ahead."
1,"Private sector demand in the United States has been stronger than expected, and could continue to surprise on the upside given the degree of household deleveraging that has already taken place."
1,"Over the period to the end of 1998, the economy is projected to expand at an annual rate of about 4 per cent."
0,"Taking into account the various indicators of capacity pressures, the Bank judges that there is material slack in the Canadian economy."
1,"The negative impact of lower oil prices will be gradually mitigated by stronger U.S. growth, the weaker Canadian dollar and the beneficial impact of lower oil prices on global economic growth."
1,Exports are expected to recover substantially in light of the anticipated growth of the U.S. economy.
0,Conditions in global financial markets have tightened in recent months as the sovereign debt crisis in the euro area has deepened and banking sector stress has remained elevated.
0,"Brazil, in particular, has been suffering a deep recession that is now expected to be more prolonged than first anticipated."
1,"The U.S. economy began to recover in the third quarter of 2009, registering growth of 2.2 per cent."
1,"The level of personal disposable income in the Bank's base-case projection is higher than in the April Report, largely reflecting historical revisions."
0,"While the effects of this adjustment are expected to dissipate, the outlook for the rest of the world is weaker relative to the January Report, reflecting further reductions in investment in the oil sector and additional fiscal cuts announced by some oil exporters."
0,The above projections indicate that the downward pressure on core inflation coming from slack in product markets will remain an important factor in coming quarters.
1,Results from the spring Business Outlook Survey indicate that the percentage of firms facing labour shortages has risen only modestly from the trough reached in the fourth quarter of 2009.
0,"Not surprisingly, responses from firms in the Prairies are particularly negative."
0,"However, the slowing U.S. economy has had a moderating effect on economic growth in Canada."
1,Economic growth is expected to remain broad-based across sectors.
1,"A number of labour market factors helped raise consumer confidence, which contributed to the considerable boost in sales of housing and durable goods in the first half of 1999 and into the third quarter."
0,"Overall, the Bank judges that the amount of excess capacity widened substantially during the first half of 2015 and has remained material in the second half, at between 1 and 2 per cent."
0,"Moreover, renewed tensions in foreign exchange markets could inhibit the necessary global adjustment and put additional pressure on freely floating currencies."
1,"The combined effects of a rise in long-term interest rates and a trade-weighted appreciation of the U.S. dollar may return the U.S. economy to a path of sustainable growth in the next few quarters, although one should not rule out the need for some monetary tightening by the Federal Reserve."
1,The Canadian economy is projected to operate slightly above its capacity through 2006 and to return to capacity by the end of 2008.
0,"The Japanese economy remains in recession, and the major European economies have been weakening."
1,"Overall, inflationary pressures have remained relatively contained in the United States, despite high and volatile energy prices."
0,Slack is also reflected in elevated levels of long-term unemployment and below-trend average hours worked.
1,"As a result, the profile for U.S. economic growth is stronger over the projection horizon than was anticipated in the last Report, despite the negative effects of higher oil prices."
1,Investments aimed at increasing capacity appear to be primarily in the energy sector.
1,The pace of expansion in business investment is projected to improve in 2013 once these effects begin to dissipate.
0,"While strong growth in net exports has provided some offset, business investment has suffered from limited access to credit and weakening consumer demand."
0,The Canadian economy contracted by 1.6 per cent (at an annualized rate) in the second quarter of 2016.
1,Growth in both short-term and long-term business credit remains solid.
0,"Nonetheless, the factors that weighed on investment growth in the second half of 2012 are expected to persist for some time."
1,The projected expansion in overall business investment is taking place despite a pullback in the energy sector associated with the recent completion of several large oil sands and offshore projects.
1,"The markets were receptive to new bond issuance, which has been strong since the last Report."
1,"Statistics Canada's measure of capacity utilization in the non-farm, goods-producing sector continues to indicate greater pressure on production capacity than the Bank's conventional estimate of the output gap."

0,Firms may decide to redirect some of their planned investment spending from Canada to the United States to benefit from the lower corporate taxes.
1,Global food and energy prices could also boost inflation more than projected in the base case.
0,The Bank of England has also lowered its policy interest rate.
1,"A slightly higher profile for oil prices than previously assumed is also incorporated, as is the estimated impact of the increase in the Quebec Sales Tax."
1,A strengthening of the pace of economic expansion in the United States provided some support for Canada's exports.
0,"Economic activity was also adversely affected by the August blackout in Ontario and by the closure of international borders to imports of Canadian cattle, beef, and related products after the discovery of one case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) last May."
0,"The weakness will be most evident in the major advanced economies, which are expected to grow at average annual rates between -0.1 and 0.6 per cent in 2009, before gaining strength in the latter part of the year and through 2010."
1,"The decline in interest rates, combined with a somewhat lower Canadian dollar, contributed to a significant easing of monetary conditions."
0,"Notwithstanding the recent pickup in employment, total hours worked are essentially flat, and the share of full-time employment has been trending down."
0,"Consequently, the projected export profile incorporates a modest downward adjustment to reflect this possibility; this initial assumption will be revised once concrete policy measures are announced and enacted."
1,"The economy is now expected to return to full capacity in the second quarter of 2011, one quarter earlier than projected in January."
1,Economic activity has picked up in several other emerging-market economies (EMEs).
1,The main upside risks to inflation relate to the possibility of a stronger-than-anticipated recovery in the global economy.
0,"Nonetheless, some tightening has been reported for smaller firms in the resource sector."
0,Weak external demand (particularly from the euro area) is dampening exports.
0,"Meanwhile, the spread between the prices of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) and Western Canada Select (WCS) has widened sharply."
0,"Government bond yields in a number of advanced economies, where markets are most liquid and which are perceived to be better credit risks, have fallen sharply, with 10-year yields trading at or near all-time record lows."
1,"Accordingly, past depreciation of the Canadian dollar continued to have a substantial impact on consumer prices over the last six months."
1,"Recent indicators, such as resales, housing starts and prices, point to continued momentum."
1,An appreciable part of the surge since 1996 has been due to the introduction of more attractive interest rates paid on demand deposits and to the decline of other short-term interest rates in recent years.

1,"Financial conditions in Canada, as in the rest of the world generally, have continued the improvement noted in the October Report."
0,"The recovery in the major advanced economies is still expected to be relatively subdued, reflecting ongoing balance sheet adjustments and the gradual withdrawal of fiscal stimulus commencing later this year."
1,"Specifically, consumption will be supported by growing household net worth and a gradual increase in disposable income."
0,Both factors contributed to declining consumer confidence through the first three quarters of 1998.

0,The increased risk premiums that emerged in Canadian interest rates became increasingly worrisome.
1,"Economic activity in other emerging-market economies (EMEs) is projected to pick up, owing to a normalization of financial conditions, more robust growth in foreign demand and further progress on economic reforms."
1,"Energy exports are now projected to grow at an annual average rate of about 1 per cent, compared with about 6 per cent in 2014."
0,This chiefly reflects the easing of demand caused by unusually mild winter weather conditions in North America.
1,"The Canadian economy grew strongly in 2017, and the level of economic activity is now close to capacity."
1,The level of potential output in the fourth quarter of 2017 is estimated to have been 0 .3 per cent higher than assumed in the January Report .
1,Underlying demographic demand and significantly improved affordability are expected to boost residential construction over the projection horizon.
1,"On this news, U.S. market rates rose further."

0,"Canadian export volumes are projected to decline through 2009, given the weakness of U.S. demand."
0,The Bank already projects a significant decline in investment in the oil and gas sector in 2015.

1,"In the United States, new government spending plans, in addition to previously announced tax cuts, are expected to boost growth over the next few years."
0,"Nevertheless, growth is expected to soften in the coming quarters, mainly as a result of earlier policy measures targeting the housing and financial sectors and a smaller contribution from fiscal policy."
0,"Geopolitical events, such as the conflict in Iraq or a renewal of tensions in Libya, could lead to a significant supply disruption in oil markets."
1,Current estimates of the Bank's conventional measures of potential output and the output gap indicate that economic slack had largely disappeared by the end of the summer.
0,"In contrast, the level of business fixed investment is still very depressed."
1,"While real GDP is expected to grow at around 2 per cent, on average, in the first half of 2018, the Bank anticipates a swing in quarter-over-quarter growth rates."
1,Steady demand from emerging-market economies and limited increases in supply should nevertheless keep prices at levels that are relatively high by historical standards.
1,"Although spreads on U.S. corporate bonds have widened modestly since May, issuance has remained solid."
0,"Oil imports, however, especially of light crude, are expected to be increasingly displaced by growing U.S. production."
0,"In Japan, economic indicators were relatively solid before the Tohoku earthquake caused major destruction and disruptions to the economy."
0,A low level of inflation for the past three years has resulted in a significant downward adjustment of inflation expectations in Canada.
1,"With wage growth expected to stay at the more moderate levels seen recently, and with excess supply being gradually absorbed, both core and total CPI inflation are expected to return to 2 per cent in the third quarter of 2011."
1,GDP growth is projected to average 2 1/2 per cent in the second and third quarters and remain above potential output growth.
1,"For example, in Western Canada, wage gains have generally been higher than in the rest of the country, reflecting a greater prevalence of labour shortages in that region."
1,Consumer confidence has hovered near post-recession highs.
1,The balance of opinion on credit conditions in the Bank's Business Outlook Survey points to an easing over the past three months.
1,The positive reaction by financial markets to the measures contained in the federal budget also provided an important steadying influence.
0,The downward pressure on inflation arising from slack in the economy should diminish as this slack is gradually absorbed through 2004.
0,"Real GDP in the euro area decreased at an annual rate of 2.3 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2012, the largest drop since the 2008-09 recession."
0,Europe is in recession and recent indicators point to a continued contraction.
0,"The Canadian economy is evolving largely as expected, but the outlook needs to be viewed in the context of elevated policy uncertainty at the global level."
1,"As the temporary factors that spurred activity in the third quarter of 2016 dissipate, growth will moderate to average about 2 per cent over the fourth quarter of 2016 and the first quarter of 2017, underpinned by solid household consumption and fiscal infrastructure spending."
0,"Real GDP, after increasing at an annual rate of 5.2 per cent in the first half of 2002, grew at a rate of 2.6 per cent in the second half, somewhat below the Bank's estimate of the growth of production capacity of 3 per cent."
0,"Nonetheless, the average duration of unemployment and the proportion of involuntary part-time workers have remained at elevated levels, while average hours worked remain relatively low."
0,"In Japan, domestic demand has been more sluggish than expected in January and should continue to be restrained by tepid wage growth."
1,"Consumer spending is expected to grow at a moderate pace over the projection horizon, while residential investment declines further from historically high levels."
1,"Nevertheless, households and firms continue to hold high levels of money balances."
1,"Increased foreign demand and fiscal spending, as well as the effects of the past depreciation of the Canadian dollar, are expected to lift real GDP growth."
1,"In the oil and gas sector, a resumption of growth in investment spending is under way in the wake of significant adjustments to past declines in commodity prices."
0,The proportion of firms reporting labour shortages in the Bank's spring Business Outlook Survey also remained below its historical average.
1,"In the spring Business Outlook Survey from the Bank's regional offices, the percentage of firms reporting that they would have difficulty in meeting an unanticipated increase in demand remained above average."
1,"The Bank anticipates continued solid consumption, supported by accommodative monetary policy and higher federal government transfers, despite weakness in the energy-intensive provinces associated with the impact of the past decline in the terms of trade."
1,Global commodity prices remain elevated.
1,This reflected increasingly positive assessments of the fiscal situation for the provinces and for the federal government as well as heightened expectations of future declines in interest rates in the United States in response to the slowing of the U.S. economy.
1,"In the first two quarters of 1996, the volume of exports increased at an average annual rate of 2.4 per cent, while the volume of imports decreased by 0.9 per cent."
1,"In 2006, economic growth in Japan is expected to strengthen further, driven largely by domestic demand, before easing to a rate consistent with the growth of production capacity in subsequent years."
0,"The projected growth in exports is also weaker than in the April Report, in line with the more subdued outlook for foreign demand."
0,"At US$4.20 per million BTU, however, prices remain well below the average level of US$5.60 recorded over the past ten years."
1,"Overall, however, total export volumes should continue to expand because of improved Canadian competitiveness, arising from the recent currency depreciation and from Canada's good price and cost performance relative to its trading partners."
1,This substantial policy easing will help boost the growth of domestic demand in Japan over the projection horizon.
1,"In addition, potential tax cuts could provide a modest boost to consumption and investment growth, although the precise effects will depend on the timing, magnitude and distribution of any cuts."
1,"Overall, most businesses continue to characterize credit as easy or relatively easy to obtain."
0,This is less than was projected in the October Report and the last Update.
0,"In addition, China's financial system could come under stress from the anticipated buildup of financial imbalances as authorities put greater emphasis on short-term growth, which could generate broader spillovers to economic activity."
1,The large surpluses that have been evident recently would imply that projected growth in spending by all levels of government will be above projected revenue growth for a period of time.
1,"The pace of economic expansion picked up in the first half of 1997, largely as anticipated."
1,"Real GDP is expected to grow by 1.7 per cent in 2016, 2.3 per cent in 2017 and 2.0 per cent in 2018."
0,The percentage of firms reporting labour shortages in the Bank's spring survey fell to the lowest level in 10 years.
1,"However, the effects of this shock are being partly offset by positive developments elsewhere."
1,The scope for above-potential growth is greater in the United States than in Canada because of the larger amount of excess capacity in the United States.
0,"Growth in domestic demand will be constrained by the effects of fiscal consolidation, lingering concerns about public finances in the peripheral countries and higher oil prices."
0,U.S. economic growth is now projected to increase at a rate below that country's growth potential in the first three quarters of the year.
0,"Given the high degree of uncertainty around real-time estimates of the output gap, it is also possible that the level of economic slack is greater than currently estimated."
0,"U.S. regional banks are not as strong financially as the large money-centre banks, and are therefore more constrained in supplying credit to businesses and households."
1,"Higher debt levels have been partly matched by higher income levels, and with interest rates at very low levels, the debt-service ratio remains low by historical standards."
0,The recent decreases in commodity prices are likely to lead to further cutbacks in production at high-cost sites.
0,"In the euro area, domestic demand remains weak."
1,Considerable monetary policy stimulus remains in place in the United States and other advanced economies in response to continuing large excess supply gaps and persistent disinflationary pressures.
0,The real growth of government spending on goods and services is projected to decelerate and to average just over 3 per cent through 2010.
1,Core inflation is expected to converge to 2 per cent thereafter as excess supply is fully absorbed.
0,"Although there are some encouraging signs, it is likely that the long lags involved in re-establishing supply chains and sales networks, as well as continued competitiveness challenges, will weigh on the ability of Canadian firms to benefit from stronger growth abroad."
0,"Consequently, the projection for investment growth has been marked down since April, with a small negative impact on potential output."
1,Economic growth in EMEs is thus expected to be relatively modest through the first half of 2013 before gradually picking up as export markets strengthen somewhat and monetary and fiscal policies provide support.
1,"The economy is then expected to grow by 2.8 per cent in 2014 and by 2.7 per cent in 2015, well above the estimated growth of potential output."
0,"Oil and gas firms, pressed by a sharp reduction in cash flow caused by the downturn in energy prices, were planning further cuts in capital spending."
1,"India and Indonesia are benefiting from successful political transitions, and structural reforms in Mexico are fostering robust growth."
1,"For example, the year-over-year increase in the average hourly wage, excluding overtime, for permanent workers was 2.0 per cent in the third quarter of 1998."
0,This decline was not anticipated.
1,"Nevertheless, on average, the prices of other industrial commodities are expected to remain firm at high levels consistent with a solid pace of expansion among the major industrial countries."
1,"National employment growth has remained firm over the past year, although it has been concentrated in part-time employment."
1,"However, economic growth is expected to gain momentum over 2013-14, as the growth of exports to advanced economies recovers."
0,"As a result, there are greater downside than upside risks to production and investment stemming from oil price movements."
1,"Total CPI inflation in October and November averaged 2.2В per cent, slightly above the Bank's expectations in the October Report."
0,Information to date suggests that economic growth slowed somewhat further in the third quarter.
0,"In Japan, economic problems have continued unabated since the May Report, largely because efforts to revive the economy are constrained by underlying structural difficulties, including ongoing problems in the financial sector."
0,"With growing slack in the economy, and a lower assumed path for commodity prices, inflation pressures in Canada are projected to ease significantly relative to the July Update."
1,"Taking all of these factors into account, the recovery in capital spending over the near term is now projected to be slightly more robust"
0,"The increased bank funding spreads are expected to be further passed on to businesses and households, creating tighter credit conditions through the rest of 2008 that then begin to dissipate in 2009."
0,"The effects of a weaker U.S. outlook and the higher assumed Canadian dollar, combined with a modest tightening in credit conditions, more than offset the stronger momentum in domestic demand, bringing aggregate demand back into line with aggregate supply a little more quickly than projected in the July Update."
1,"Household credit also remains readily available at near-record low rates, owing in large part to exceptionally low long-term fixed mortgage rates."
1,"In the near term, households will have money saved on energy purchases to reallocate."
1,"In light of these and other developments, funding conditions have improved for European banks."
1,Housing market activity has been very strong in some segments of the national market.
1,"Japanese authorities have taken additional steps to stimulate growth and alleviate pressures on their currency, including further monetary and fiscal policy easing and the first intervention in foreign exchange markets in six years."
0,"First and foremost, the intensification of the global financial crisis in recent weeks has been reflected in severe strains in global money and credit markets and sharp falls and extreme volatility in global equity markets."
0,"In particular, the effects from the ongoing global retrenchment in the information and telecommunications sectors had become a much stronger force than was initially recognized."
1,"On 16 April, the Bank raised the target to 2.25 per cent, modestly reducing the amount of monetary stimulus in the economy, in the light of information that a robust recovery appears to be underway."
0,"Growth in other oil-importing EMEs slowed in 2015, reflecting the effects of lower prices for non-energy commodities, spillovers from China's slowdown and tighter financial conditions."
1,"However, it is also important not to lose sight of the positive elements supporting continued expansion of the Canadian economy - a declining public sector debt-to-GDP ratio, restructuring of the private sector, and low and stable inflation."
1,"Despite this evidence, a number of other indicators suggest that conditions remained tight in certain product and labour markets in the first three quarters of this year."
0,"In the July Update, the economy was seen as operating a bit below its capacity in mid-2005."
0,"Banks in a number of economies, such as the United States and the United Kingdom, have experienced a relatively modest rise in funding costs, while banks in the euro area are facing increased pressures."
0,Recent data suggest that underlying fundamentals for household spending have weakened over the past few months.
0,"Thus, the overall pace of economic expansion was somewhat slower than was expected in the last Report."
1,"In addition, exports of services continued to post positive growth in 2014."
1,"Growth in the narrow money aggregates has slowed somewhat in recent months from the very rapid pace recorded in early 2000, but it remains strong on a year-over-year basis."
1,"The favourable developments in Europe mainly reflect more robust household spending, buoyed by temporary government incentive programs for car purchases and substantial support from automatic stabilizers."
0,"Although corporate bond yields remain close to their historical lows, corporate credit spreads have widened, especially for high-yield issuers."
0,"Owing to significant excess capacity, policy interest rates in the major advanced economies remain at or near historic lows, and underlying inflation pressures are subdued."
1,"In addition, as the economy approaches full capacity, firm creation and business investment could rise by more than expected, and workers who have left the labour force or who were underemployed would be fully re-employed, boosting potential output over the projection period."
0,"The deterioration in industrial production in  Germany and France suggests that depressed demand from the peripheral countries is increasingly affecting activity in the core countries, especially business investment."
0,"Debt issuance by non-financial corporations remains difficult, and new debt issues are generally being priced at rates higher than indicative rates in secondary markets."
0,"The fiscal stimulus incorporated into the projection is now assumed to begin somewhat later than in the January projection, reflecting possible legislative challenges."
1,"Growth in both the emerging-market and European economies has accelerated, and the pace of the economic expansion in the United States has increased even further."
0,"While the degree of excess capacity has declined since the January Report, the Bank judges that in the first quarter of 2017 it remains material, between 1 1/4 and 1/4 per cent."
0,"Reflecting the ongoing weakness in activity in advanced economies, China's export growth has decelerated recently."
0,"However, bank funding costs have been edging up more recently, prompting some financial institutions to increase mortgage rates by about 5 to 15 basis points."
0,"Real GDP growth moderated sharply in the fourth quarter of last year, however, and is projected to average less than 2.0 per cent per year through 2013 as the impetus from the rebuilding of infrastructure wanes."
0,"A regional house price correction would have important adverse effects on residential investment, related consumption and real estate services in the affected regions."
1,"In Japan, activity related to reconstruction helped boost the growth of real GDP to 5.6 per cent in the third quarter of 2011."
1,"This reacceleration appeared to largely reflect transitory factors that boosted the demand for mortgage credit, notably the lagged effects of the surge in sales of existing homes in the fourth quarter of last year, as well as some pulling forward of activity related to recent changes to mortgage insurance regulations."
1,"Equities have rebounded, spreads on Canadian corporate bonds have declined significantly, and corporate bond issuance has picked up."
0,"These include elevated uncertainty about the global economic outlook, lower energy prices received by Canadian producers and the softness in domestic demand."
1,The positive trend in investment spending is expected to reassert itself in the second quarter of 2018.
0,"Growth is projected to decelerate gradually over the projection period, however, as tighter monetary and fiscal policies reduce excess demand and inflationary pressures."
0,"Over the projection horizon, residential investment as a share of GDP is expected to edge down."
0,"Canadian exports of automobiles in the second quarter of 1997 were adversely affected by temporary parts shortages, however."
0,This drop in core inflation reflected several unforeseen developments over the last six months.
1,"At the same time, the more robust profile for domestic demand is partly offset by a larger drag from net exports associated with a stronger US dollar."
1,"A large rebuilding of manufacturing inventories, following a drawdown in the previous quarter, also added significantly to growth."
0,Demand for Canadian exports could be weaker than expected if authorities in the United States do not smooth the path of fiscal consolidation to avoid the fiscal cliff or if the slowdown in emerging-market economies is greater than expected.
1,"New construction is forecast to contribute positively, particularly in Ontario, where housing demand has been outpacing supply."
0,"Total CPI inflation is also projected to be more subdued than was anticipated in July, mainly reflecting the lower profile for core inflation."
0,"Finally, aggregate prices have been restrained by two other factors: lower housing prices and lower costs for machinery and equipment because of falling computer prices."
0,"Productivity growth may edge down this year along with output growth, so unit labour costs may increase, but only modestly."
0,"Securitized markets nevertheless remain impaired, despite a number of private and public sector initiatives under way to revive them."
0,Residential investment remains very weak.
0,This slowdown in global economic growth reflects the weakening in the U.S. economy and the dislocations in global financial markets stemming from problems in the U.S. subprime-mortgage market.
1,"Meanwhile, exchange rates are helping to redistribute global demand."
0,Many respondents expecting inflation to be in the lower half of that range cited a lack of momentum in domestic demand and lower oil prices as the main drivers.
0,"And political developments in the Middle East may continue to affect crude oil prices, with possible repercussions for the global economy."
1,"In the services sector, travel services have benefited from the lower Canadian dollar and the resulting change in travel patterns."

0,"After growing at a healthy pace in the second half of 2013, the world economy experienced a sharp and broad-based slowdown in economic activity and trade in the first quarter of this year."
1,"The Bank's conventional measure of the output gap indicates that the economy was operating about 0.8 per cent above its production potential in the third quarter of 2007, slightly higher than projected in the July Update."
0,"Economic activity in the euro zone has not been as strong as expected, partly reflecting uncertainty concerning labour market and other structural reforms, as well as higher energy prices."
0,"Despite these encouraging developments, a material degree of slack persists in the labour market, as illustrated by the Bank's labour market indicator."
0,Price growth in other parts of Canada was much more subdued.
0,"Foreign banks operating in the United States have tightened approval standards on loans to U.S. corporations, while both U.S. and foreign banks tightened conditions on loans to banks headquartered in Europe and to non-financial firms with significant exposures to European economies."
1,Exchange rate movements are facilitating a realignment of global activity.
1,"Output in the four major European countries, which rose by an estimated 3 per cent during 1994, may increase by a similar rate this year."
0,"Uncertainty related to structural reform appears to have resulted in increased precautionary savings in significant parts of Europe, while in China the need to self-insure against health risks and to provide for education costs is leading households to save a very large proportion of their income gains."
1,The pace of U.S. economic activity is expected to improve gradually through 2013 and 2014.
1,"In the second quarter, real GDP growth is projected to begin to exceed potential growth, leading to a narrowing of the output gap."
0,EMEs with large stocks of debt denominated in foreign currencies remain particularly vulnerable to sudden shifts in market sentiment.
1,"A gradual recovery, initially supported by external demand, should then take hold."
1,The Bank expects further economic slack to be taken up through 1998.
0,"Meanwhile, in emerging-market economies, financial conditions have tightened, and market volatility has increased, partly in response to political uncertainty."
1,The U.S. economy appears to have expanded at a healthy pace in 2015.
0,This is also less than previously anticipated and reflects evidence suggesting considerably weaker inventory accumulation by businesses than in the second quarter.
0,"Some other U.S. assets, including real estate investment trusts, high-yield corporate debt and municipal bonds, have registered larger declines in prices."
1,"Consistent with this, the largest cumulative gains in actual and planned capital spending for 2004 and 2005 occurred in commodity-producing industries in response to the substantial rebound in global commodity prices and the expectation that these price gains would persist for some time."
1,"This has been most evident in Southeast Asia, where there have been signs of significant progress towards economic stabilization."
0,"Income from wages and salaries continued to fall, as did employment (by 9 per cent since last October in the mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction industries)."
1,A recovery in economic activity is also under way in Canada.
0,"Non-commodity exports have remained disappointingly weak in recent quarters, despite the strengthening U.S. economy over this period."
1,"However, a modest upward trend in the overall commodity price index should resume by mid-1997, which should support Canadian production."
1,Stronger-than-expected private demand in the United States is the most important upside risk to inflation in Canada.
0,"With the exception of government spending, all the major components of aggregate demand fell in the first quarter."
1,"Recent indicators suggest that the labour market has continued to improve gradually, in tandem with the turnaround in real GDP."
0,The intensification of the decline in the Canadian dollar and the rise in Canadian medium - and long-term interest rates signalled an undermining of the confidence of holders of Canadian dollar financial instruments.
1,"In contrast, monetary policy is projected to remain highly accommodative."
0,"In view of the recent sharp decline in world prices for energy and food, global consumer inflation likely peaked during the third quarter."
0,"Over the medium term, global macroeconomic imbalances continue to pose significant risks to the outlook."
1,The most recent indicators for spending and activity suggest that economic growth resumed in the third quarter but remained slightly below potential at about 2.5 per cent.
0,"With further increases in supplies and ongoing reductions in stocks by users, prices for pulp and paper may continue to decline over the near term."
1,"At the same time, expectations of continued strong demand for housing in North America for 2004 and a desire by U.S. lumber wholesalers to restore inventories to more normal levels contributed to a sharp rise in lumber prices."
0,"This base-case scenario assumes that the crisis in the euro area will be contained, although this assumption is clearly subject to downside risks."
1,"The European Central Bank (ECB) and the Bank of England have raised policy interest rates to counter the inflation risks from stronger demand and, in the case of the ECB, the decline in the external value of the euro."
1,"While monthly inflation has picked up markedly in the past six months, this is mainly the result of larger price increases in categories that are not believed to be affected by the degree of slack or competition in the Canadian economy."
1,"U.S. consumption is projected to grow at a steady pace of approximately 2 per cent through 2013, supported by a gradual recovery in the labour market that more than offsets the dampening effects of ongoing household balance-sheet repair and the drag on personal disposable income coming from fiscal consolidation."
0,"With the continuing large amount of excess supply in the Canadian economy, the outlook for the next half year is for inflation to remain in the lower part of the inflation-control target range."
0,"During this past summer, evidence had begun to accumulate that the economic slowdown in North America would be deeper and last longer than had previously been expected."
1,Wage rates are expected to rise at a moderate rate through 1998 because of low price inflation and continued excess supply in the labour market.
0,"With increased risks of layoffs, those households whose incomes rely on the oil sector will have greater incentives to build precautionary savings or pay down debt."
1,"For example, these pressures have resulted in marked increases in the prices of shelter and some services."
0,"However, there are remaining elements of unemployment and underemployment: the long-term unemployment rate is still relatively high, the youth participation rate has room to increase, and BOS respondents in the oil- and gas-producing regions continue to point to remaining labour market slack."
1,The growth outlook for most other regions is also modestly stronger than anticipated in the January Monetary Policy Report.
1,"Exports of non-energy commodities, such as lumber products, are also expected to strengthen."
0,"The weakness in household spending is mainly due to lower expected real incomes, stemming from the deterioration in labour market conditions, weaker terms of trade, and lower growth in potential output."
0,"The recession in the euro area is now expected to last longer and to be somewhat deeper than anticipated in the October Report, owing to tighter credit conditions, additional fiscal austerity measures and more negative confidence effects."
1,"Such advances may have boosted productivity in ways that are not readily measured, adding to global potential growth and thus implying that there is more excess capacity than is captured by standard estimates."
0,"The Bank continues to project, however, that the recovery in exports will be subdued relative to earlier global recoveries, with the higher level of the Canadian dollar assumed in this projection adding to long-standing competitiveness challenges."
1,Both external and domestic factors suggest that economic activity should expand faster in the second half of 1996 than was the case between mid-1995 and mid-1996.
0,A modest further appreciation of their real exchange rates should also help to restrain export growth.
1,The other major development internationally has been the sharp rise and volatility in world oil prices.

0,The U.S. Federal Reserve moved quickly to reduce official interest rates in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks.
1,The growth of business credit currently stands close to its 10-year average.
0,"At the same time, the weaker economic growth in the second quarter of 2006, combined with projected growth of 2 per cent in the third quarter (compared with a projection of 3 per cent in the July Update), implies that the level of activity in the third quarter was also somewhat lower than expected."
1,"With the significant improvement in Canada's terms of trade in the second half of 2005, the chain price index for GDP (a broad price measure of the goods and services produced in Canada) rose 4.1 per cent between the fourth quarter of 2004 and the fourth quarter of 2005."
1,"The pace of economic growth in Canada is expected to have accelerated to 3.3 per cent in the final quarter of 2009, with final domestic demand and exports continuing to grow rapidly and import growth moderating."
0,Some of the weakness in recent months may also be due to weather-related factors.
1,"The pickup in growth is driven largely by stronger consumption spending, assisted by the recent decline in oil prices, as well as a rebound in manufacturing production as imports of motor vehicle parts from Japan gradually return to normal."
0,This uncertainty is likely to weigh on the decisions of businesses and households for some time to come.
0,"While the Bank's projection for exports is cautious, there is a risk that exports will fall short of expectations, given continuing competitiveness challenges."
1,"Crude oil prices rebounded sharply earlier this year, mainly reflecting fears of supply disruptions in the event of an outbreak of hostilities in the Middle East."
1,"In the fourth quarter of 2016, growth has been revised up by 0.3 percentage points to 2.5 per cent."
1,"Nonetheless, total export volumes should continue to register solid gains because of Canada's improved competitiveness."
0,This suggests that labour markets are not as tight as would be indicated by the conventional measure of capacity output.
1,The measure is projected to surpass its pre-recession level during the second half of 2013.
1,"In part, this more favourable near-term outlook reflects temporary factors, such as the rebound in auto production and pent-up demand for housing."
1,"In particular, building materials, fabricated metal and non-metallic mineral products have posted robust growth in recent months."
0,"In contrast, the growth of government spending on goods and services lessened appreciably."
0,"As a result, the level of Canada's exports is not forecast to regain its pre-recession peak until the first half of 2014."
1,"The economy is expected to reach its production capacity in the third quarter of 2011, as projected in the October Report."
1,"Fundamental factors supporting the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar include a resilient domestic economy, favourable interest rate differentials, and firm commodity prices."

1,And the contingency arrangements mentioned above should prevent significant movement in interest rates in response to year-end pressures.
0,"The announcements of stabilization measures by European authorities and the International Monetary Fund have helped to improve market conditions since then, but spreads on sovereign debt for the most-affected countries in the euro area remain considerably wider than at the time of the April Report, and overall financial conditions are tighter and more volatile."
0,"Core inflation is projected to moderate through 2012 to a level somewhat below 2 per cent, as excess supply persists and the effects of higher prices for food and clothing on year-over-year inflation unwind."
1,"On an annual average basis, growth in U.S. real GDP is expected to be 2.0 per cent in 2013, 3.1 per cent in 2014 and 3.3 per cent in 2015."

1,Monetary and fiscal stimulus is having positive effects.
0,"Indeed, corporate debt and equity issuance have effectively stopped."

1,The 1997 forecast was marginally higher than six months earlier.
0,"The forces at play resulted in considerable volatility in monetary conditions over the past six months, and the Bank's monetary conditions index (MCI) has fluctuated over a relatively wide range."
0,"Although immediate risks have diminished, the policy challenges facing Europe remain considerable and a failure to contain the crisis remains the most serious risk facing the global and Canadian economies."
1,"In Canada, the economic expansion has been proceeding largely as expected in the April Report."
1,"Through the July-August period, there was a positive shift in sentiment towards North American currencies."
0,"These difficulties have been heightened by a lack of liquidity, a widespread process of deleveraging by financial institutions, and the deteriorating outlook for the U.S. economy."
0,"Another important downside risk is that the global recovery could be even more protracted than projected if self-sustaining growth in private demand, which will be required for a solid recovery, takes longer than expected to materialize."
1,"The Canadian economy has been expanding at a rate above its growth potential, with levels of activity now close to full production capacity, and there have been remarkable gains in employment."
0,"The euro-area composite Economic Sentiment Indicator (ESI) and the composite Purchasing Managers' Indexes both fell to near 3-year lows, and the ESIs for France and Germany have continued to slide."

0,"First, there is the risk of a buildup of inflation pressures in the United States and the implications for Canada."
0,"Although the prices of certain commodities will likely come under downward pressure in the near term, a modest upward trend in the overall commodity price index should begin sometime in early 1997."
1,"However, as markets re-evaluated the relative cyclical positions of the world's major economies, the U.S. dollar subsequently recovered beyond its pre-attack level."
0,"There is some evidence that HST-related tax refunds to businesses may also have been passed through, dampening core inflation in line with the Bank's expectations."
1,"Moreover, historical data show that an acceleration in the real value of M1 is typically followed by an increase in the rate of growth of real GDP."
1,"In this context, the upside risks to oil prices identified in previous Reports have already partially materialized: the price assumption has risen by about US$10 per barrel relative to the April Report, although this increase was also partly a result of temporary supply disruptions."
0,Failure to contain the crisis in Europe remains the most serious risk facing the global and Canadian economies.

0,Such developments have contributed to the decrease in the yields on the long-term government bonds of major industrialized countries since mid-year.
0,"The level of real GDP has been markedly lower in the second and third quarters than the Bank had projected, suggesting that the output gap in the third quarter was considerably wider than anticipated in July."
1,"This increase mainly reflects market expectations of a shift in the policy mix under the incoming US administration, with an anticipated fiscal expansion bringing higher growth, inflation and policy interest rates."
0,Falling commodity prices resulted in declines in the prices of most manufactured intermediate goods.
1,"As a result, total CPI inflation is still expected to converge to core inflation at the 2 per cent target by the middle of 2012."
1,"Since a large share of investment goods are foreign-sourced, this strengthening of investment is expected to lead to an increase in imports."
1,"Prices for West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil have rebounded to roughly US$100 per barrel, reflecting low global inventories and geopolitical tensions."
1,A wide range of export sectors are expected to benefit from the continued strengthening of the U.S. economy.
1,Prices for resale housing have increased markedly with the rebound in consumer confidence and as record-low mortgage rates have increased affordability.
1,"The underlying strength of the balance sheets of Canadian financial institutions, corporations, and households has made the Canadian financial system better able to weather global storms."

1,"Recent data remain consistent with a broad-based pickup in non-energy exports, in line with a continued strengthening of the U.S. economy and the past depreciation of the Canadian dollar."
0,"The lacklustre pace of business spending has been assumed to reflect mostly cyclical factors, such as slower growth of global demand and heightened uncertainty."
0,"This weakness in demand has led to product cutbacks in the manufacturing sector, primarily in automobiles and electronics (telecommunications and computer equipment) to correct inventory imbalances."
0,"Another imbalance in the U.S. economy, reflecting the unsustainably high levels and growth of demand relative to supply, is the large current account deficit."
0,A combination of disappointing productivity performance and persistent strength in the Canadian dollar could dampen the expected recovery of Canada's net exports.
0,Responses for the other provinces suggest that excess capacity has gradually diminished over the past few years but may have widened more recently in response to weaker demand.

1,Global growth is expected to be somewhat stronger over the 2011-12 period than was anticipated in the October Report.
1,"Third, the drag exerted by the housing market correction in the united states and several other industrial countries should diminish, leading to a pickup in construction activity."
0,The combination of strong global demand and increased likelihood that oil prices will remain above previously expected levels has heightened the risk that inflation rates in major industrial countries will continue to move up.
0,"In the fourth quarter of last year, however, profitability eased off in many of these industries, following a reduction in the global demand for Canadian products and a further appreciation of the Canadian dollar from the middle of 2004."
0,Weaker-than-expected household spending would have a direct negative impact on real GDP.
1,"After levelling off during the first half of 1995, economic activity in Canada edged up somewhat in the second half."
