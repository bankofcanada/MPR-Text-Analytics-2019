0,"xbos xfld 1 In addition to the factors noted above, some of this weakness would also appear to be cyclical in nature, reflecting the inventory correction and more general weakness in the manufacturing sector."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Favourable financial conditions and ongoing improvements in business balance sheets have led to a strengthening of total business credit growth, which is approaching a level in line with its historical averages."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Consumer and business confidence, which were already low in the periphery, have also dropped markedly in the core economies."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Based on budget announcements, the Bank assumes that fiscal stimulus will end in early 2011, and that the contribution of government spending to overall real GDP growth will turn mildly negative."
0,"xbos xfld 1 In addition, if producers are able to find further cost savings or if US oil firms take advantage of the recent firming in prices to hedge future production, the rebalancing of the market may be more protracted than expected."
0,"xbos xfld 1 But, as the Bank emphasized in previous Reports, it also reflects competitiveness challenges and structural issues."
0,"xbos xfld 1 In Southeast Asia, financial markets have stabilized, progress is being made on structural reforms, and prospects are good for a gradual recovery through this year and next."
0,xbos xfld 1 The main upside risk comes from rising house prices and increased spending related to borrowing against home equity.
0,"xbos xfld 1 A negative cycle is under way in which persistently high rates of mortgage delinquency are creating stress for financial institutions, leading to greater caution in the extension of credit and exacerbating the weakness in housing demand."
0,xbos xfld 1 Other broad measures of price inflation have also picked up in 1995.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Wages, the largest component of total costs, have risen very moderately."
0,"xbos xfld 1 As confidence rebuilds, the considerable amount of monetary stimulus in place, together with recently announced increases in government spending and previously announced tax cuts, is expected to support strong growth in domestic spending."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Bond yields remain higher than in 2017 in some regions, reflecting actual and expected changes in monetary policy."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Exports, however, were considerably weaker than expected, contributing to a larger-than-anticipated buildup of inventories."
0,"xbos xfld 1 In line with the new outlook, some further monetary stimulus will likely be required to achieve the 2 per cent inflation target over the medium term."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Overall, growth in M2++ is consistent with the path for inflation implied by the growth in narrow money."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Given the speed and magnitude of the oil price decline, there is substantial uncertainty around the likely level for oil prices and their impact on the economic outlook for Canada."
0,xbos xfld 1 The sharp drop in oil prices as well as lower commodity food prices have been key common factors behind weak total CPI inflation globally.
0,"xbos xfld 1 With medium - and longer-term expectations of inflation well anchored, the inflation projection largely reflects the combined influence of the balance between aggregate demand and supply, and relative price developments."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Final domestic demand continued to contribute significantly to GDP growth in the second half of 2005, while net exports were little changed over the period."
0,"xbos xfld 1 All told, especially given the recent strength in investment, the extent of the weakness in overall productivity remains somewhat puzzling."
0,xbos xfld 1 The Bank assesses that loss of investment competitiveness due to US tax reforms and uncertainty associated with global trade policies will together lower the level of exports by about 0.6 per cent between the third quarter of 2018 and the fourth quarter of 2020.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Although growth rebounded in the fourth quarter of last year, real GDP growth in the third quarter was weaker than had been expected, and there was a downward revision to GDP in the second quarter."
0,xbos xfld 1 The foreign activity measure is projected to return to its pre-recession level in early 2014.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Drawing across all export categories, more granular analysis reveals new sources of export growth (such as steel forms and some food products), which rose from essentially zero in 2010 to more than $500 million in total in 2014."
0,"xbos xfld 1 On an overall G-10 basis, while showing considerable volatility, the Canadian dollar has remained at or above the levels that prevailed through much of 1996."
0,xbos xfld 1 Most of this growth came from the expansion of the working-age population.
0,"xbos xfld 1 On balance, the core rate of inflation is expected to be just over 1.5 per cent over the remainder of 2003."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Prices that Canadian consumers pay and prices that Canadian producers receive can differ because not all Canadian-produced goods are consumed in Canada, and many goods consumed in Canada are produced elsewhere."
0,xbos xfld 1 The Bank continues to expect that the gradual strengthening of the global economy and the recent depreciation of the Canadian dollar will lead to a broadening of the composition of growth in Canada.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Yields on both Canadian government and corporate bonds have stayed at exceptionally low levels, partly because of sustained international demand for the debt of Canadian governments, banks and corporations, a sign that their credit quality is perceived to be high by global standards."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Nonetheless, persistent weakness in global business investment and slow progress in implementing structural reforms in a number of economies continue to limit the growth of potential output."
0,xbos xfld 1 Responses to the Bank's summer Business Outlook Survey also suggest an increase in capacity pressures.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Economic growth is still anticipated to moderate from around 6 1/2 per cent in 2018 to around 6 per cent in 2020, as part of the continued transition to more sustainable growth."
0,xbos xfld 1 But risks remain.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Expectations of inflation, as noted earlier in Technical Box 2, are influenced both by recent developments in inflation and by the credibility of the Bank's inflation-control strategy."
0,"xbos xfld 1 An increased sensitivity of consumption to interest rates has been incorporated in the Bank's projection model since October, but it is still too early to determine whether this behaviour is showing up in the data on consumer spending."
0,"xbos xfld 1 The core rate of inflation was 1.5 per cent in August, up from 1.1 per cent last February."
0,"xbos xfld 1 In this context, a gradual rebound in investment in machinery and equipment and in non-residential buildings is expected, while weakness in engineering spending associated with the resource sector should persist."
0,"xbos xfld 1 This outlook assumes that spending by all levels of government will increase broadly in line with revenues, as governments continue to strive to maintain fiscal balance."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Gains in private sector employment have been broadly based, both by province and by industry."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Both the Bank's winter Business Outlook Survey and the statistical measure of the output gap suggest that the gap is quite small, while the structural estimate of the output gap suggests that the gap is larger, on the order of about 1 per cent."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Global economic growth for 2009 has been revised down in the Bank's latest projection, reflecting the recent sharp decline in economic activity."
0,"xbos xfld 1 In addition, some Canadian firms, which have had generally healthier profits than their US counterparts, may have relied on internal funds to finance expenditures."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Both global trade and investment growth have firmed, reflecting the more synchronous expansion worldwide and the bottoming-out of the effects of the oil price shock."
0,"xbos xfld 1 In the case of Canada, short - and medium-term interest rates have moved up."
0,xbos xfld 1 Inflation has picked up since the fourth quarter of 2015 and is expected to reach 2 per cent by 2018 as labour market slack is gradually absorbed.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Canada's economic growth has moderated, and the economy is operating close to capacity."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Real GDP grew by 3.5 per cent in the third quarter of 2011 and is estimated to have risen by 2.0 per cent in the fourth quarter, above expectations in the October Report."
0,"xbos xfld 1 The profile for total inflation is somewhat lower than in the January Report, mainly because of more subdued core inflation."
0,xbos xfld 1 The Bank's conventional measure indicates that the output gap was -2.3 per cent in the first quarter.
0,xbos xfld 1 Broad definitions of money based on M2+ decelerated in the second quarter.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Even so, with global demand for commodities projected to remain relatively strong, in line with robust global growth, the overall level of non-energy commodity prices is projected to stay high in relation to historical norms."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Meanwhile, exchange rate pass-through from the past depreciation of the Canadian dollar has been exerting temporary upward pressure, which the Bank estimates added 0.8 to 1.0 percentage points to total CPI inflation in the first quarter of 2016."
0,"xbos xfld 1 In this context, Canadian banks continue to be well positioned to lend, with ready access to relatively low-cost funding across the term structure in both Canadian and foreign currencies."
0,xbos xfld 1 This stimulus is fuelling strong domestic demand growth.
0,"xbos xfld 1 In these circumstances of strong economic expansion, high levels of economic activity relative to capacity, and increased energy prices, the challenge for monetary policy will be to judge the balance between aggregate demand and supply, to guard against the risk that higher energy prices could affect core inflation and expectations of future inflation, and to adjust monetary conditions in a timely manner so as to preserve the low trend of inflation that has been benefiting the Canadian economy."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Goods inflation is subdued, largely reflecting low food and consumer energy inflation."
0,xbos xfld 1 Failure to contain the crisis in Europe remains the most serious downside risk facing the global and Canadian economies.
0,xbos xfld 1 There is gathering evidence that the needed supply-demand adjustment in the global oil market is progressing.
0,xbos xfld 1 Other asset classes have also been affected by changes in market sentiment.
0,"xbos xfld 1 These developments, and their implications for the demand for Canadian goods and services, are leading to shifts in activity and employment among sectors and to major adjustments by many firms."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Although modest recovery in private domestic demand is still projected to more than offset the drag from the unwinding of fiscal stimulus, the overall outlook for US economic growth is weaker than was anticipated in the July Report."
0,"xbos xfld 1 More recently, core inflation has firmed."
0,xbos xfld 1 Both natural gas and crude oil prices have risen considerably following colder-than-normal weather in much of North America and Europe.
0,xbos xfld 1 The Bank's base-case projection incorporates the following key assumptions: a Canada/US exchange rate averaging 103 cents US; energy prices in line with recent futures prices; persistently strong prices for non-energy commodities; and supportive global credit conditions.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Overall, US real GDP growth is expected to rise from 1.9 per cent in 2013 to 3.0 per cent in 2014 and 3.2 per cent in 2015."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Since the start of the year, both the Canadian and US dollars have risen quite strongly against the newly introduced euro and other overseas currencies."
0,"xbos xfld 1 This slower growth is only partially offset by a modest upward revision to trend labour input growth, reflecting higher levels of immigration."
0,xbos xfld 1 Spot prices and futures prices for crude oil have moved up since July.
0,"xbos xfld 1 At the same time, with the adjustment in the stock-to-sales ratio completed, business inventories are expected to provide very modest support to overall real GDP growth over the projection horizon."
0,xbos xfld 1 Manufacturers and telecommunications companies both boosted investment outlays considerably.
0,xbos xfld 1 This base-case projection incorporates some further reduction in monetary stimulus to maintain a balance between aggregate supply and demand in the Canadian economy and thus keep inflation on target.
0,"xbos xfld 1 In the United States, information released since the July Report points to a much lower path for US real GDP in recent years than earlier estimates had suggested."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Notably, there are signs of increasing fragmentation of European financial markets, with reduced cross-border financial activity and an evident home bias in investment portfolios."
0,"xbos xfld 1 The Toronto Stock Exchange, which posted a sizable decline after 11 September, is now about 20 per cent higher than the trough recorded last September."
0,xbos xfld 1 These deposits are distorting the information content of the narrow aggregates because accounts held by financial institutions would net out if the monetary aggregates were constructed on a fully consolidated basis.
0,"xbos xfld 1 This increase has been relatively widespread across households, businesses, and account types."
0,xbos xfld 1 The Bank judges that these risks are roughly balanced.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Economic growth resumed in the third quarter of 2009, with real GDP increasing by a meagre 0.4 per cent (at annual rates), less than had been anticipated in the October projection."
0,"xbos xfld 1 In other regions, growth is healthy, although risks have risen in some emerging-market economies and China."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Faced with higher funding costs, European banks are restricting access to credit and charging higher interest rates on loans to businesses and households."
0,xbos xfld 1 Such a correction could have sizable spillover effects to other parts of the economy.
0,"xbos xfld 1 While the weather likely explains most of the rebound in resale transactions in recent months, its magnitude and broad-based nature leave open the possibility of renewed momentum in the resale market."
0,xbos xfld 1 This should improve the environment for business investment.
0,"xbos xfld 1 While a wide range of export sectors are expected to benefit from the continued strengthening of the US economy, a sustained rebound in non-energy exports has proven elusive."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Ongoing momentum in the residential real estate sector and renewed increases in home prices have raised concerns about imbalances in the sector, prompting Chinese policy-makers to introduce additional measures to limit housing demand."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Similarly, results from the winter Business Outlook Survey indicate that firms' expectations for inflation over the next two years remain within the Bank's 1 to 3 per cent inflation-control range."
0,xbos xfld 1 The 12-month rate of increase in the total CPI fell to 2.1 per cent in August from 2.8 per cent in May.
0,"xbos xfld 1 While the decision to focus monetary policy on price stability is fundamental, and therefore long-term, judgments about what policy actions should be taken require regular reconsideration."
0,"xbos xfld 1 There is considerable uncertainty around the profile for total CPI inflation: oil prices are very volatile, and the historical relationship between gasoline and crude oil prices may not assert itself as quickly as assumed in the base-case projection."
0,"xbos xfld 1 In particular, the difference between the current policy rate and the neutral rate is an important determinant of the degree of support that policy is providing to economic activity."
0,"xbos xfld 1 The lower Canadian dollar, in contrast, is expected to continue to exert some upward pressure on inflation over the next few quarters."
0,"xbos xfld 1 The September 2018 Consensus Economics forecast for CPI inflation is 2.4 per cent in 2018 and 2.1 per cent in 2019, with long-term annual inflation expectations averaging 2.0 per cent through 2028."
0,xbos xfld 1 Financial conditions in the advanced economies remain highly supportive of economic growth.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Consumer confidence could also strengthen further with improvements in employment and income prospects, resulting in greater acceleration in household spending."
0,"xbos xfld 1 The economic outlook in Canada has weakened, reflecting the substantially downgraded outlook for the global economy."
0,xbos xfld 1 Results from the summer Business Outlook Survey also suggest that growth will continue to broaden.
0,"xbos xfld 1 However, as predicted in earlier issues of this Report, these transitory disturbances have had little effect on the trend of inflation."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Even with recent interest rate increases, the stance of monetary policy in Canada remains accommodative and continues to support the level of economic activity."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Primarily because household expenditures are more robust than expected, growth is stronger in 2017 and 2018 than projected in April."
0,"xbos xfld 1 After trading in a range of 79 to 83 cents US for most of 2005, the Canadian dollar has been trading in a higher range of 84 to 86 cents US since late summer."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Since last November, the unemployment rate in the energy-producing provinces has risen markedly, while it has remained roughly flat, on average, across others."
0,"xbos xfld 1 For instance, in the first quarter of 1998, the year-over-year increase in the average hourly wage, excluding over-time, was 1.5 per cent for all permanent employees and 2.4 per cent for permanent full-time employees."
0,xbos xfld 1 This Report presents a detailed assessment of the global and domestic factors that are shaping the outlook for the Canadian economy through 2003.
0,"xbos xfld 1 The US slowdown has, in fact, turned out to be more pronounced than expected, and, largely as a consequence, growth in global demand has been weaker than projected."
0,"xbos xfld 1 In 2003, total CPI inflation is expected to move back in line with core inflation."
0,"xbos xfld 1 In Canada, economic growth through to the end of 2005 is expected to come primarily from domestic demand."
0,xbos xfld 1 The Bank's base-case projection calls for growth of real GDP to be 2.7 per cent in 2005 and to rise to 3.3 per cent in 2006.
0,xbos xfld 1 Some of this reflects rising deposits in current accounts in response to the more competitive interest rates paid on some of these accounts.
0,xbos xfld 1 These developments provide a favourable environment for future economic growth.
0,xbos xfld 1 Wider negative short-term interest rate spreads that followed the increases in US short-term interest rates have worked against the Canadian dollar.
0,xbos xfld 1 Recent data point to a somewhat stronger pickup in global economic growth than had been expected at the time of the January Monetary Policy Report.
0,"xbos xfld 1 While the Bank's projection for exports is cautious, there is a risk that exports will fall short of expectations, given continuing competitiveness challenges."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Oil prices have been relatively stable since January, reflecting a number of offsetting factors."
0,"xbos xfld 1 In the United States, the Federal Reserve lowered its target for the federal funds rate by 50 basis points on 6 November 2001 and by 25 basis points on 11 December 2001, bringing the total reduction since January 2001 to 475 basis points."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Spending by business in 1999 on machinery and equipment, especially computers, remained very strong, which bodes well for future productivity growth."
0,xbos xfld 1 Worries over growth in China are pulling down prices for base metals.
0,xbos xfld 1 This growth profile implies that the economy is now projected to return to full capacity by the end of 2013.
0,"xbos xfld 1 If world energy prices remain at or below their early-September levels, the rate of increase in the total CPI is projected to fall to close to 2 per cent by the end of this year and to move below the midpoint of the target range in 2002."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Lower oil prices will curtail business investment in energy-related industries, restrain housing activity in energy-intensive regions and provide some incentives for households whose incomes rely on the oil sector to build precautionary savings."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Other dampening factors include the shifting of production away from relatively high-productivity resource extraction industries and costs associated with relocating or retraining labour, including implicit costs such as temporary underemployment and increased numbers of discouraged workers."
0,"xbos xfld 1 In the Bank's base-case projection, average annual real GDP growth is projected to be 1.4 per cent in 2008, 2.4 per cent in 2009, and 3.3 per cent in 2010."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Indeed, there is a strong possibility that auto insurance premiums will decrease markedly in a number of provinces in coming months, reflecting either legislated or proposed provincial government initiatives."
0,xbos xfld 1 These assumptions are close to current market expectations.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Core inflation is forecast to remain around 2 per cent over the projection horizon, as the economy operates near its production potential and inflation expectations stay well anchored."
0,xbos xfld 1 The rise in the Canadian dollar since early 2003 is also likely to continue to put a limited amount of downward pressure on the core rate over the remainder of 2004.
0,"xbos xfld 1 The unexpectedly marked increases in core inflation reflect a combination of one-off factors, higher costs for key inputs, and robust domestic demand."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Second, some of the effect of the intense competitive pressures in the retail sector that has been putting downward pressure on inflation should wear off in coming months."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Similarly, labour market conditions will continue to moderate wage and cost pressures."
0,"xbos xfld 1 In China and other major emerging economies, growth has slowed somewhat more than expected, though there are signs of stabilization around current growth rates."
0,"xbos xfld 1 As well, while just under 90 per cent of firms in the Bank's autumn Business Outlook Survey expected CPI inflation to be within a range of 1 to 3 per cent, on average, over the next two years, 54 per cent of respondents expected inflation to be in the upper part of the range."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Despite the relatively subdued outlook for global economic growth, external demand for Canada's exports, as indicated by the foreign activity measure, is projected to grow moderately in 2012 and to pick up further in 2013 in response to an improvement in US residential construction and a rebound in the growth in US business investment."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Based on the available information, and factoring in the impact of the rail strike, it appears that total output expanded by around 3 per cent in the first quarter."
0,xbos xfld 1 This range suggests about 1/4 of a percentage point less excess capacity than was estimated in October for the third quarter.
0,"xbos xfld 1 With some lessening in the growth of global demand, prices for non-energy commodities are unlikely to rise appreciably through the remainder of 2001."
0,xbos xfld 1 The Bank of England raised its repo rate by 25 basis points in November and again in January to counter developing pressures in labour markets and on productive capacity.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Greater-than-expected improvements in housing and labour markets in the United States could boost consumer and business confidence in that country, resulting in stronger export demand for Canadian goods and services."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Over time, this headwind is also expected to dissipate and the global expansion to continue, supported by highly accommodative monetary policies and increasingly buoyant financial conditions."
0,"xbos xfld 1 The Canadian dollar has traded in a range of about 79 to 83 cents US since the time of the April Report, as it has since the beginning of the year."
0,"xbos xfld 1 US export growth in 2012 has been affected by slowing external demand and the past appreciation of the US real effective exchange rate, but is projected to strengthen gradually starting in the second half of 2013 as global demand growth begins to recover."
0,"xbos xfld 1 With this marked pickup in productivity growth, unit labour costs in the business sector are below year-earlier levels."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Labour market indicators suggest, in general, that the economy is operating close to potential."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Consumption is expected to grow at a moderate rate, somewhat below that of disposable income, resulting in a further slight increase in the personal savings rate."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Prices for Western Canada Select have fallen by more than 20 per cent since the release of the July Report, owing to higher production levels, ongoing transportation constraints and lower demand due to refinery outages in North America."
0,"xbos xfld 1 However, the Bank has chosen not to fully quantify the implications of more protectionist policies."
0,"xbos xfld 1 In response to the evolving global situation, a number of major central banks have continued to tighten their monetary policy since the April Report."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Lumber prices are likely to ease over the remainder of this year, given the projected weakness of US housing activity."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Partly as a result, Canada's current account balance has declined from a surplus position before the recession to a deficit of around 4 per cent of GDP."
0,xbos xfld 1 Firms cite retail competition and subdued economic growth as factors that are expected to keep inflation low.
0,"xbos xfld 1 On the upside, private demand might have greater momentum than expected, reflecting strong confidence and easy credit conditions."
0,xbos xfld 1 Expectations are also an important component in the outlook for inflation.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Indeed, market interest rates, in Canada and elsewhere, incorporate expectations of such adjustment to policy interest rates."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Over the past year, exports of services, driven by transportation services and travel services, have outperformed goods exports, and strong growth is projected to continue."
0,xbos xfld 1 Plans to increase investment are more widespread among service-oriented firms and often involve smaller-scale expenditures on information technology.
0,"xbos xfld 1 In turn, businesses would increase hiring and investment by more than expected, providing further support for household spending and economic activity more generally."
0,xbos xfld 1 Renewed expansion in the export-oriented sector can be expected to generate further growth in employment and income.
0,"xbos xfld 1 However, a severe tightening of fiscal policy at the beginning of 2013 (the fiscal cliff) is built into current legislation, which could reduce US real GDP growth next year by up to 4 percentage points if it is not amended."
0,xbos xfld 1 The previous portfolio shifts into more-liquid assets should begin to reverse with an improving economic outlook and the normalization of credit conditions.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Domestic demand is expected to remain the principal driver of growth over the projection horizon, though at a more subdued pace than previously anticipated."
0,"xbos xfld 1 The US Federal Reserve has recently lengthened the duration of its program to extend the average maturity of its holdings of securities from June 2012 to the end of the year and continues to expect that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate, at least through late 2014."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Canadian exports are now projected to be weaker than anticipated in the July Report, owing to the significantly weaker outlook for foreign demand."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Consumption, especially of services, remained robust, benefiting from the rollout of the Canada Child Benefit."
0,"xbos xfld 1 As with exports, business investment is anticipated to increase over the projection horizon, triggered by expanding economic activity in both the non-resource and resource sectors."
0,xbos xfld 1 Financial markets also continue to have a healthy appetite for the security offerings of Canadian corporations.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Second, in the context of declining commodity prices, business investment contracted more than expected."
0,xbos xfld 1 Underlying the base-case projection are a number of key assumptions.
0,xbos xfld 1 The above projections indicate that the downward pressure on core inflation coming from slack in product markets will remain an important factor in coming quarters.
0,"xbos xfld 1 While most measures of near-term inflation expectations have stayed fairly high, consistent with the short-term outlook for total inflation, longer-term measures are well anchored to the 2 per cent inflation target."
0,"xbos xfld 1 The Bank judges the resulting level of the overnight rate, 25 basis points, to be the effective lower bound for that rate."
0,"xbos xfld 1 While credit spreads for corporate and household borrowing are expected to improve over the course of the projection horizon, higher borrowing costs, reduced availability of credit as financial deleveraging proceeds, and tighter lending standards will continue to exert a significant drag on real economic activity."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Moreover, investment could continue to advance rapidly since resources that were devoted to dealing with year-2000 concerns can now be redirected towards adding to capacity."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Prices have been supported by political tensions in parts of the Middle East as well as pipeline outages, particularly in Libya and the North Sea."
0,"xbos xfld 1 The decline in core CPI inflation has been greater than anticipated, reflecting somewhat softer prices across a wide range of goods and services."
0,"xbos xfld 1 In contrast, agricultural prices have declined following a seasonal drop in livestock prices and expectations of stronger global crop yields."
0,xbos xfld 1 Core inflation is expected to average about 1.5 per cent for the rest of 2004 and to move back to the 2 per cent target by the end of next year.
0,"xbos xfld 1 In this regard, the Canadian economy is projected to operate with slightly less slack throughout the projection horizon than indicated in the October base-case scenario, reflecting the slightly higher level of economic activity seen recently."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Financial conditions for banks, non-financial corporations and sovereigns in other countries generally remain very supportive."
0,"xbos xfld 1 As the economy picks up in the fourth quarter and accelerates in 2010-11, excess supply is gradually absorbed, and the economy is expected to reach its productive capacity in the third quarter of 2011."
0,"xbos xfld 1 But with geopolitical uncertainty lessening, world oil prices down significantly, and financial conditions improving, the risks confronting the global economy are better balanced."
0,xbos xfld 1 The March Consensus Economics forecast for total CPI inflation was 1.5 per cent for 2014 and 1.9 per cent for 2015.
0,"xbos xfld 1 The Bank's monitoring of available information points to real GDP growth of about 3.2 per cent in the second quarter, as previously anticipated."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Looking ahead, the Bank of Canada's non-energy commodity price index should remain stable over the projection horizon."
0,"xbos xfld 1 US real GDP grew by close to 2.5 per cent in the second half of 2011, from less than 1 per cent over the first half of the year, and recent economic developments have been largely positive."
0,"xbos xfld 1 In particular, the export prices of crude oil, natural gas, and wheat all fell considerably during the first half of 1997."
0,xbos xfld 1 Second is the generalized weakening of the US dollar against all major currencies in the second quarter of 2009.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Consequently, Bank staff estimate that the output gap narrowed from about 1.75 per cent at mid-year to about 1.25 per cent at the end of the year."
0,xbos xfld 1 The future evolution and economic repercussions of ongoing global financial market developments represent an uncertainty for the outlook.
0,"xbos xfld 1 However, the Bank has not yet incorporated into its projection the impact of fiscal measures expected in the next federal budget."
0,"xbos xfld 1 While lower oil prices would benefit consumers, the effect on Canada would, on balance, be negative, reducing Canada's terms of trade and domestic income."
0,xbos xfld 1 The recovery in the housing market continues to gain traction.
0,xbos xfld 1 GDP growth in the quarter increased partly because of a resumption of investment growth in the oil and gas sector after a long period of steep declines.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Household consumption has also been weak because of tighter credit conditions, falling housing and equity prices, declining employment, and high prices for energy and food."
0,xbos xfld 1 Inventory decumulation is projected to subtract significantly from GDP growth during the first three quarters of this year.
0,"xbos xfld 1 The current level of potential output could be higher than estimated, resulting in more excess supply and less inflationary pressure than currently assessed."
0,"xbos xfld 1 In addition, the spring Business Outlook Survey indicated that capacity pressures have moderated but are still close to recent highs, particularly outside the oil- and gas-producing regions."
0,xbos xfld 1 The Bank expects global growth to pick up to just above 3 1/2 per cent in 2016 and 2017.
0,xbos xfld 1 A marked rebound is expected in the third quarter as oil production resumes and the rebuilding effort gets under way in the Fort McMurray area.
0,"xbos xfld 1 In Japan, growth in domestic demand is expected to be weaker than had been anticipated in July, although some pickup remains likely as labour market conditions improve."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Real GDP is expected to grow at about the same pace as potential output over the projection period, averaging 2.8 per cent in 2005, 2.9 per cent in 2006, and 3 per cent the following year."
0,"xbos xfld 1 On the upside, the substantial reductions in investment since 2014, coupled with rising demand, may mean there is insufficient capacity to satisfy demand over the medium term."
0,"xbos xfld 1 With well-anchored inflation expectations, core inflation is projected to return slowly to 2 per cent around the end of 2015 as excess capacity is absorbed."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Real GDP is estimated to have grown by 2.8 per cent in the first quarter, reflecting strength in monthly data on GDP, merchandise trade, housing and retail sales at the start of the year."
0,"xbos xfld 1 In other advanced economies, particularly the euro area and Japan, growth is expected to remain weak despite additional policy stimulus, as the headwinds from deleveraging and uncertainty dissipate gradually."
0,xbos xfld 1 There also continues to be considerable uncertainty about Canadian trend productivity growth.
0,"xbos xfld 1 In addition, price cutting for long-distance telephone service and computer products has been particularly intense recently."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Recent data suggest that a broad-based pickup in exports is under way, in line with a continued strengthening of the US economy and the past depreciation of the Canadian dollar."
0,"xbos xfld 1 The price for light crude oil (West Texas Intermediate), which was US$65 per barrel at the time of the January Update, averaged US$70 in the ten days ending on 21 April 2006."
0,xbos xfld 1 This suggests that household finances should not be a drag on economic growth in the period ahead.
0,xbos xfld 1 Rising house prices have improved the net worth of households and have facilitated cheaper access to borrowed funds.
0,"xbos xfld 1 In fact, short-term market interest rates in Canada and the United States, having already risen in anticipation of the policy actions, were virtually unaffected by the rate announcements themselves."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Second, some firms are relying on internal funds to finance expenditures, since corporate profits have remained healthy despite the recent retreat from the record high level seen in the first quarter."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Year-over-year growth in the price index for core personal consumption expenditures has slowed to 1.1 per cent in recent months, a record low."
0,"xbos xfld 1 In the United States, elevated uncertainty and high unemployment may induce households to increase savings and reduce consumption growth more than is currently expected."
0,"xbos xfld 1 On the supply side, US shale production levelled off in April after rising steadily since 2010 and is expected to decline in the second half of 2015, reflecting a sharp drop in the number of active drilling rigs since November 2014."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Residential investment is expected to expand at a robust pace of 9 per cent per year through 2018, although it has been revised down in light of a reassessment of underlying housing market fundamentals."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Growth is estimated to have improved in the third quarter of 2011, supported by the recent decline in commodity prices and the restoration of supply chains following the natural disasters in Japan."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Although the People's Bank of China eased monetary policy earlier this year, higher inflation due to rising food prices may limit the scope for further easing."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Uneven growth prospects across regions and expectations of diverging monetary policy paths have been reflected in higher levels of financial market volatility, particularly in fixed-income and foreign exchange markets."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Potential output grew more slowly in the first half of 2008 than estimated in previous Reports and Updates, and growth over the near term will likely be lower than previously assumed as well."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Over the projection horizon, growth in business fixed investment is expected to strengthen as the recovery in Canadian exports becomes more firmly entrenched, providing greater confidence about the prospects for global demand."
0,xbos xfld 1 The Bank expects growth in business fixed investment to return to a more solid pace through 2013 after slowing through the second half of 2012.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Credit spreads for both financial and non-financial issuers remain near record levels but have begun to narrow recently; with the continued decline in government yields, the level of borrowing rates has held relatively steady."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Further corrective policy action will be required over the medium term to put global growth on a strong, yet sustainable and balanced, path."
0,"xbos xfld 1 to ease slightly by 0.1 per cent from 1.25 per cent in 2007 and 2008, implying potential growth of about 2.7 per cent."
0,xbos xfld 1 Firms are expected to plow back their profits to meet anticipated demand and replenish their inventories.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Strengthening demand, as well as supply constraints, could contribute to higher oil prices."
0,xbos xfld 1 The first is the assessment of the size of the output gap.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Recent global initiatives to improve the functioning of financial markets have included the provision of significant additional overnight and term liquidity, capital injections for financial institutions, guarantees of bank deposits and borrowing, and purchases of bad assets."
0,xbos xfld 1 Stock market indexes in advanced economies have continued to climb amid improving economic sentiment and conditions.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Since the lost activity is expected to be largely recovered in the third quarter, the Bank will look through the volatility induced by these temporary factors when assessing the degree of excess capacity in the Canadian economy."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Furthermore, if demand for commodities from emerging markets remains robust and the ability of producers to increase global supplies is constrained, upward pressure on many commodity prices may intensify."
0,"xbos xfld 1 These sectors include manufacturers of intermediate metal products, fabricated metals, non-metallic mineral products, as well as other electronic and electrical machinery, equipment and parts."
0,"xbos xfld 1 As reflected in the Bank's base-case scenario, for inflation to be sustained at 2 per cent, excess capacity in the economy will have to be absorbed."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Financial conditions in Canada have been favourable in recent months, providing ongoing support to the economic recovery."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Despite recent improvements to the outlook for the global and Canadian economies, risks remain elevated."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Other emerging-market economies are also expected to experience strong growth over the next three years, supported in many cases by increased export demand from China."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Government spending on goods and services increased by less than had been anticipated, and it appears that the rise in provincial health-care spending, related to measures in the 1999 federal budget, will take place more gradually than expected."
0,xbos xfld 1 The Bank forecasts an improvement in the underlying momentum of the economy through 2014 as external demand strengthens and business confidence rises.
0,"xbos xfld 1 By increasing home equity and thus expanding the availability of collateral, the recent strong increases in house prices have contributed to robust growth in consumer credit."
0,xbos xfld 1 This was partly offset by a continuing decrease in the terms of trade as commodity prices fell further.
0,"xbos xfld 1 This could lead to increased volatility, capital outflows and severe financial market turbulence."
0,"xbos xfld 1 The prices for Brent, West Texas Intermediate and Western Canada Select in US dollars have averaged roughly $60, $55 and $40, respectively, since early December."
0,"xbos xfld 1 In particular, household and construction spending have slowed markedly from the very high levels seen earlier."
0,xbos xfld 1 These developments are consistent with an orderly resolution of global imbalances.
0,xbos xfld 1 The average rate of growth projected for exports over 2017 and 2018 is lower than anticipated in July.
0,xbos xfld 1 Several important factors are helping to facilitate these adjustments.
0,"xbos xfld 1 The growth of business investment should ease during the projection period from the strong pace registered in 2007, owing to the effects of slowing global economic growth, the tightening of credit conditions, and increased uncertainty resulting from the financial market turbulence."
0,"xbos xfld 1 The sovereign debt crisis in Europe has intensified, conditions in international financial markets have tightened and risk aversion has risen."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Further escalation of trade tensions, a faster than anticipated pickup in wage and price inflation, or significant increases in expectations of the future path of monetary policy could lead to higher term premiums and equity risk premiums."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Thus, measures of broad money that take account of this substitution have grown more rapidly than M2+."
0,"xbos xfld 1 These include strong world economic growth, the high level of commodity prices, declining prices for many manufactured goods, and the appreciation of the Canadian dollar."
0,xbos xfld 1 Credit conditions are assumed to return to more normal levels in 2010.
0,"xbos xfld 1 For the 2004-06 period, annual growth in hours worked in the business sector averaged about 1.8 per cent, which was well above expectations."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Credit conditions, other than for housing (for example, for auto financing), have eased considerably."
0,xbos xfld 1 Increased uncertainty related to global geopolitical tensions and the resolution of corporate reporting and governance issues are likely to cause some businesses to delay major capital expenditures.
0,xbos xfld 1 The deterioration in financial conditions is projected to persist for some time and to be increasingly transmitted to households and businesses through tighter borrowing conditions.
0,xbos xfld 1 The impact on the core CPI of this year's substantial hike in crude oil prices is still predicted to be small.
0,"xbos xfld 1 It will take time to repair household and bank balance sheets, and for financial conditions to return to normal."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Equity prices have also risen in advanced economies since the January Report, in some cases breaching previous peaks, but are basically unchanged in emerging-market countries."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Growth in Canada's exports is projected to pick up but remain relatively moderate despite stronger growth in foreign activity, owing to ongoing competitiveness challenges, including the persistent strength of the Canadian dollar."
0,"xbos xfld 1 As a result, household spending rose solidly, after a very strong gain in the second quarter."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Capacity constraints are most apparent in Western energy-producing provinces, where increases in oil and gas prices have raised revenues and generated gains in profits and investment."
0,xbos xfld 1 The hand-off from public stimulus to private demand in advanced economies is proceeding but has yet to be accomplished.
0,xbos xfld 1 The Bank continues to expect that the rotation of aggregate demand in Canada away from household and government expenditures toward business fixed investment and net exports will persist over the projection horizon.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Despite the upward revision to their spending profile in 2009 and 2010, households are expected to remain cautious in light of the continued weakness in labour markets and the erosion in household wealth from past declines in equity and house prices."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Consumer prices for natural gas are projected to decrease substantially over the remainder of 2006, as the recent downturn in wholesale prices becomes more fully reflected in regulated prices and contracts."
0,xbos xfld 1 Growth in non-energy commodity exports is expected to remain subdued.
0,xbos xfld 1 The results of both the Business Outlook Survey and consultations conducted by the Bank indicate that businesses expect to continue to focus on digital technologies to grow their productive capacity.
0,"xbos xfld 1 The Bank expects inflation to be close to 2 per cent from early 2017 onward, when temporary factors will have dissipated and as economic slack is absorbed."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Accounting for these factors, economic activity is estimated to have expanded by 1.3 per cent in the first quarter and is forecast to rebound and grow by 2.5 per cent in the second quarter."
0,"xbos xfld 1 In peripheral European countries, the necessary fiscal adjustment has just begun."
0,"xbos xfld 1 While investment and trade are projected to expand, they are being restrained by the US tariffs recently imposed on Canadian steel and aluminum imports and by uncertainty around trade policies."
0,"xbos xfld 1 As a result, economic activity in Canada is projected to remain sluggish through the first quarter of next year, then to pick up over the rest of 2009 and to accelerate to above-potential growth in 2010, supported by improving credit conditions, the lagged effects of monetary policy actions, and stronger global growth."
0,"xbos xfld 1 The potential amount of a price increase is limited, however, because ongoing cost-cutting initiatives and technological advances are helping to lower production costs, in particular, for unconventional oil production, such as shale oil."
0,xbos xfld 1 Unit labour costs in the business sector in the third quarter of 2005 were 2.6 per cent higher than year-earlier levels.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Underlying inflationary pressures remain subdued in light of persistent excess capacity, particularly in the labour markets of a number of advanced economies, where wage growth remains weak."
0,"xbos xfld 1 This latest reading was weaker than anticipated, reflecting lower inflation for food and gasoline, as well as sector-specific shocks to telecommunications prices."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Measures of inflation in the United States have moved slightly higher than expected, apparently reflecting a stronger response to continued strong growth, the cumulative increase in commodity prices, and the sizable real effective depreciation of the US dollar since 2002."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Nevertheless, at 15 per cent, year-over-year growth in gross M1 remains strong."
0,"xbos xfld 1 If oil prices were to stabilize at levels just below US$30 a barrel, the rate of increase in the total CPI would be expected to move down to about 2 per cent by the end of 2001."
0,xbos xfld 1 Strong growth brought output close to potential and was accompanied by a significant reduction in labour market slack.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Overall, the full range of current indicators suggests that the economy is operating close to capacity."
0,xbos xfld 1 Ongoing monetary policy stimulus has limited the rise in yields in the euro area and Japan.
0,"xbos xfld 1 In the case of lumber, the imposition of a countervailing duty on exports of softwood lumber to the United States resulted in a surge in prices paid by US consumers, which has largely been reversed."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Bond markets in many countries in the G-10 area, including Canada, have been buoyant, partly because of an improved inflation outlook, and partly because of the flight of capital from Asian countries."
0,xbos xfld 1 High world oil prices through much of 2007 and 2008 have also depressed household and business spending.
0,"xbos xfld 1 As a result, the impact on year-over-year inflation should dissipate by the end of next year."
0,"xbos xfld 1 The year-over-year increase in the average hourly wage (excluding overtime) for permanent workers was 3.5 per cent in the third quarter of 2000, up from 3.0 per cent in the fourth quarter of 1999."
0,xbos xfld 1 The projected rise in trend labour productivity assumes benefits from the growth in business investment that will contribute to further capital deepening.
0,"xbos xfld 1 In addition, the gradual pass-through of the surge in world agricultural commodity prices has resulted in a significant rise in core food prices."
0,xbos xfld 1 Strong money growth over this period is largely due to the easing in monetary conditions.
0,"xbos xfld 1 After reviewing all the indicators of capacity pressures, the Governing Council now judges that the economy was operating at its production capacity in mid-2005."
0,"xbos xfld 1 However, while the drag from household deleveraging is expected to diminish over the projection horizon, tighter fiscal policy and a gradual improvement in employment suggest that consumer expenditures will grow only modestly."
0,"xbos xfld 1 In addition, the drag from household deleveraging is expected to diminish over the projection horizon, given the considerable progress households have made in repairing their balance sheets."
0,xbos xfld 1 Total CPI inflation is expected to be 1.9 per cent in the second quarter of 2007.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Some indicators, however, point to more slack."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Although policy initiatives to address the sovereign debt and banking crisis in the euro area have resulted in some improvement in European debt markets and global financial conditions, this risk could re-escalate, affecting Canada through financial, confidence and trade channels."
0,"xbos xfld 1 European growth has strengthened, despite ongoing sovereign debt and banking challenges in the periphery."
0,xbos xfld 1 Recent private sector forecasts are broadly consistent with this scenario.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Coupled with the pickup in sales, these developments should lead to a decline in the stock-to-sales ratio."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Of the various components of income, corporate profits have so far borne the brunt of the shock, with profits declining by almost 15 per cent since the third quarter of 2014."
0,"xbos xfld 1 On 8 September 2010, the Bank raised its target for the overnight rate by one-quarter of one percentage point to 1 per cent."
0,xbos xfld 1 Those headwinds are also expected to temper the positive effects of lower oil prices on advanced economies.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Wage growth has also continued to be moderate, consistent with the persistence of slack in the labour market."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Even though the Bank's projection assumes that steps are taken to contain the crisis, growth is expected to be restrained by ongoing bank and sovereign deleveraging and only a gradual recovery in confidence."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Domestic demand should also be boosted this year by the provisions of the February 1999 federal budget, which suggest a marked pickup in health-related government spending."
0,xbos xfld 1 Business investment has been bolstered by healthy corporate balance sheets and the low cost of capital.
0,"xbos xfld 1 At the same time, the gap between lending rates in the core and peripheral countries has narrowed, with the exception of Greece."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Recently revised data show significantly stronger US output growth in the latter half of the 1990s than was originally reported, with correspondingly stronger growth in labour productivity."
0,"xbos xfld 1 However, as we have pointed out in this Report, there are some important risks to this projection."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Third, substantial easing in US monetary policy should continue to boost GDP growth in 2009 and beyond, particularly as financial market dislocations are worked out."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Meanwhile, imports increased moderately, following an exceptional surge in the third quarter."
0,xbos xfld 1 The inventory situation also appears to be close to balance.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Contagion from recent developments in Greece has been felt most acutely in euro-area financial markets, impacting banks, non-financial corporations and other euro-area sovereigns."
0,"xbos xfld 1 In particular, prices for both durable and semi-durable goods were weaker than anticipated, which may have partly reflected lower international prices."
0,"xbos xfld 1 In the core economies, activity has picked up noticeably, led by strength in exports."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Core inflation (which excludes the effect of changes in indirect taxes, as well as eight of the most volatile CPI components) should remain at about 2 per cent throughout the projection period."
0,"xbos xfld 1 The substantial gains in Canada's final domestic demand in recent years have also led to a marked rise in capital spending in many sectors with a low exposure to international trade, especially electric power generation, finance and insurance, information and cultural industries, and the manufacture of refined petroleum products."
0,"xbos xfld 1 In the euro area, real GDP grew modestly in the fourth quarter of 2010 as bad weather disrupted activities in the construction sector."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Real GDP growth in other advanced economies has slowed recently and is expected to be subdued in coming quarters, reflecting a weakening in external demand, declining household and business confidence, and continued drag from fiscal consolidation."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Equity prices have fallen modestly in Europe since the last Report, reflecting renewed concerns over the debt situation, but have improved in most other economies."
0,xbos xfld 1 And spending by all levels of government is projected to rise broadly in line with revenues as governments strive to maintain fiscal balance.
0,"xbos xfld 1 The forecast for 2015 is 1.1 per cent, close to recent inflation data."
0,"xbos xfld 1 On the downside, for example, the anticipated return of Iranian oil production, if not offset by production cuts elsewhere in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries , could delay the rebalancing of the market."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Nevertheless, strains remain in certain markets, and further setbacks are possible."
0,xbos xfld 1 But this effect should disappear as the output gap closes.
0,"xbos xfld 1 While the outlook for actual and potential GDP growth in the United States has been revised downward, it is possible that this reflects an overly cautious interpretation of labour force and productivity trends."
0,xbos xfld 1 This chiefly reflects the easing of demand caused by unusually mild winter weather conditions in North America.
0,xbos xfld 1 Exchange rate movements and changes in indirect taxes can also affect aggregate consumer and producer price measures differently.
0,"xbos xfld 1 The latest futures curves suggest that prices will increase further, rising slightly above US$4 per million BTU by the end of 2015, owing to growing demand for electricity generation."
0,"xbos xfld 1 In response to low prices, many oil producers, particularly those with higher-cost projects in US shale and the Canadian oil sands, have announced steep cuts to their capital expenditure budgets, and drilling activity has fallen sharply."
0,xbos xfld 1 Core inflation is now expected to remain around 2 per cent over the projection horizon.
0,"xbos xfld 1 This means that, following the increases in short-term interest rates, monetary conditions have been somewhat less stimulative compared with the very accommodative range of -5.0 to -6.0 that had prevailed for much of 1997."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Accordingly, growth in expenditures by all levels of government combined is projected to be quite strong in 2006 and 2007, before easing somewhat in 2008."
0,xbos xfld 1 This larger gain relative to the core rate was caused mainly by substantial increases in the consumer prices of gasoline and fuel oil from their levels a year earlier.
0,xbos xfld 1 The strong gains in final domestic demand generated further solid output growth in sectors with a low exposure to foreign competition.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Competitive pressures in the retail sector have also been intense, leading to discounts on semi-durable consumer goods such as clothing and footwear, and, to a lesser extent, on durables such as automobiles and household appliances."
0,xbos xfld 1 Two polar scenarios were envisaged.
0,"xbos xfld 1 The latest survey of investment intentions, conducted by Statistics Canada in late 1998 and early 1999, calls for a small decline in business investment this year."
0,xbos xfld 1 This drop stemmed mainly from the sizable decline in the prices of oil and natural gas from the high levels of a year ago.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Nonetheless, both the growth and level of exports are expected to remain high."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Since the May Report, the international economic environment has continued to improve."
0,"xbos xfld 1 On a trade-weighted basis, the Canadian dollar is down slightly relative to last April."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Compared with the April Report, average annual growth is projected to be slightly lower this year, owing to the weakness in the first quarter, while projected growth for 2009 and 2010 is essentially unchanged."
0,xbos xfld 1 Underlying fundamentals are strong and would support a more robust growth trajectory were it not for the effects of heightened uncertainty around trade policy and increased incentives to shift investment from Canada to the United States as a result of US tax reforms.
0,xbos xfld 1 The Bank's base-case scenario is predicated on the assumptions that the crisis in the euro area will remain contained and that a severe tightening of US fiscal policy will be avoided.
0,"xbos xfld 1 While the further deterioration in the terms of trade and associated income and wealth prospects will have a dampening effect, a resilient labour market will help to support demand growth."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Job gains continue to be elevated amid a tight labour market, and indicators of consumer sentiment remain high."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Nevertheless, fiscal consolidation and, to a lesser degree, household deleveraging will continue to restrain activity."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Nevertheless, in recent months, there have been some signs of slowing in interest-rate-sensitive sectors."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Strong spending, combined with elevated consumer confidence, points to underlying strength."
0,xbos xfld 1 The Bank's outlook for investment spending in 2010 is consistent with the results reported in its spring Business Outlook Survey and Statistics Canada's 2010 Beginning-of-Year Survey of Private and Public Investment Intentions.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Meanwhile, global equity prices remain near recent highs."
0,"xbos xfld 1 In Japan, real GDP growth in the first quarter, at 5.0 per cent, continued to rebound sharply, supported by substantial fiscal stimulus and a strong increase in exports."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Growth in US economic activity is estimated to have been about 1.25 per cent over the first half of the year, weaker than assumed in the April Report and well below that country's growth potential."
0,"xbos xfld 1 In the absence of a sustained period with productivity growth above 2 per cent to offset the virtual absence of productivity growth in 2003 and 2004, the balance of risks around the Bank's previous assumption for trend productivity growth of about 1 3/4 per cent has shifted to the downside."
0,xbos xfld 1 Other measures of trend inflation that the Bank follows closely also rose to about the same rate.
0,"xbos xfld 1 However, growth could be even stronger if tax reform and deregulation in the United States trigger ""animal spirits"" in an environment of accommodative financial conditions, elevated equity prices and high corporate profits."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Moreover, the negative long-term differential against the United States has persisted despite the safe-haven attraction of US dollar investments."
0,"xbos xfld 1 In the Bank's spring Business Outlook Survey, 78 per cent of firms expected total CPI inflation to be within a range of 1 to 3 per cent, on average, over the next two years, and the percentage of respondents expecting inflation to be above 3 per cent has decreased from the autumn survey."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Economic, financial, and geopolitical uncertainty has also figured prominently in the global economic picture over the past six months."
0,"xbos xfld 1 The latest futures curves suggest a modest decline in Brent crude oil prices over the projection horizon as geopolitical tensions abate, while WTI prices are expected to remain relatively flat."
0,"xbos xfld 1 With this improvement, real income rose more rapidly than real output (measured by real GDP), as evidenced by substantial gains in corporate profits, labour income, and government revenues."
0,"xbos xfld 1 In the Bank's autumn Business Outlook Survey, the percentage of firms reporting difficulties in meeting an unanticipated increase in demand remained above average."
0,"xbos xfld 1 The Bank continues to expect robust growth in business fixed investment over the projection horizon, reflecting the strong financial positions of Canadian firms, favourable credit conditions, high commodity prices and the strong Canadian dollar, as well as the impetus to improve productivity amid heightened pressures to become more competitive."
0,"xbos xfld 1 A wide range of export sectors are expected to benefit, including those linked to US construction activity, such as logging and building materials."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Recent indicators for spending and activity point to a strengthening in the pace of economic expansion in the fourth quarter, with growth at about 4 per cent - a rate above that of potential."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Nonetheless, the revisions to the conventional measure now suggest that the economy may have moved into a position of excess demand in the first half of 2000, since aggregate output growth continued to outstrip the estimated expansion of capacity."
0,xbos xfld 1 The most useful monetary aggregate for forecasting inflation one or two quarters ahead is the broad aggregate M2+.
0,"xbos xfld 1 In addition, continued expansion in the emerging markets of Southeast Asia is expected, as is a recovery in Latin America."
0,"xbos xfld 1 This has led the Bank of Japan to maintain its policy of keeping the overnight interest rate at zero, for the time being."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Business investment will remain a source of drag, however, as the energy sector continues to adjust to low oil prices."
0,xbos xfld 1 The April Consensus Economics forecasts for total CPI inflation were 1.4 per cent in 2013 and 1.8 per cent in 2014.
0,xbos xfld 1 The rise in core inflation was associated with an economy operating at or above capacity at the end of 2000.
0,"xbos xfld 1 These factors include low policy interest rates, the gradual elimination of excess supply in the housing sector, and the normalization of credit conditions, which are expected to support the recovery in domestic demand."
0,xbos xfld 1 Prices for energy commodities have been mixed in recent months.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Although global economic growth is slowing, the momentum in the first half of the year has been stronger than earlier expected."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Through 2003, these effects are expected to diminish, so that in the second half of the year, core inflation should return to its 2 per cent target."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Trend labour input growth will continue to slow, due to population aging, with immigration providing only a partial offset."
0,"xbos xfld 1 In this regard, the additional prudent and timely measures recently announced by federal authorities are expected to contribute to a more sustainable evolution of housing market activity in Canada."
0,"xbos xfld 1 In part, this is because potential output responds to stronger aggregate demand through increased business investment, firm creation and greater labour force participation."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Core inflation should remain below 2 per cent through the first half of 2006, but rise to 2 per cent in the second half of this year, earlier than expected in the January Update, owing to increases in electricity prices."
0,"xbos xfld 1 These factors include the impact of the unwinding of the sharp rise in global agricultural prices on core food prices, as well as lower auto insurance premiums in Ontario."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Short-term inflation expectations appear to have edged up in response to observed price increases, although they remain within the Bank's inflation-control target band."
0,"xbos xfld 1 By convention, the Canadian dollar is assumed to be close to its recent average level of 80 cents over the projection horizon, similar to the 79 cents assumed in the April Report."
0,"xbos xfld 1 The 12-month rate of increase in the total CPI continued to be above the Bank's 2 per cent inflation-control target, averaging 2.6 per cent in April and May of 2006."
0,"xbos xfld 1 The scope for sustained higher prices is limited, however, because technological advances have contributed to lower production costs for unconventional oil production, notably shale oil in the United States."
0,xbos xfld 1 Medium - and long-term interest rates have fallen further below those in the United States.
0,xbos xfld 1 The 90-day differential vis-à-vis the United States has dropped to about - 200 basis points.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Together, weaker exports and business investment pose a downside risk to inflation."
0,"xbos xfld 1 The challenge for monetary policy will be to carefully assess the balance between aggregate demand and supply in these circumstances of strong growth and high levels of activity, and to adjust monetary conditions in a timely manner in order to preserve the low trend of inflation that has been benefiting the Canadian economy."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Total CPI inflation, excluding the effect of the HST, is expected to be slightly higher over the coming year than was projected in the January Report."
0,"xbos xfld 1 While the Bank's foreign activity measure, an indicator of demand for Canadian exports, is expected to grow strongly over the forecast horizon, it has been revised down."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Based on its assessment of all indicators, it is the Governing Council's judgment that the economy was operating with slightly more excess supply at mid-year than the conventional measure suggests, but was still close to its capacity limits."
0,xbos xfld 1 Growth in the narrow aggregates has been greater than expected since February but remains well below the rates experienced at the end of 2000.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Overall, aggregate demand grew somewhat faster than the estimate of the economy's capacity to produce in the second half of 1998."
0,xbos xfld 1 This dynamic is also expected to stimulate a more solid contribution from business fixed investment over time.
0,xbos xfld 1 Household borrowing costs are also very low by historical standards.
0,"xbos xfld 1 According to the latest Business Outlook Survey, inflation expectations are little changed."
0,"xbos xfld 1 The index reflects the exceptionally low level of the policy rate, which is offsetting higher-than-normal spreads on corporate bonds and tightening in lending standards."
0,"xbos xfld 1 CPI inflation is projected to rise temporarily, reaching 2.5 per cent in the third and fourth quarters of 2018 before returning to about 2 per cent."
0,xbos xfld 1 These lower risk premiums provide a stimulus to economic activity.
0,"xbos xfld 1 In contrast, the Canadian dollar prices of many exports of finished goods with longer-term contracts in US dollars rose with the Canadian dollar's depreciation against the US dollar."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Deteriorating conditions in the US labour market during the summer, together with other indicators, suggested that the pickup in growth in the second half of the year would be more gradual than earlier expected."
0,"xbos xfld 1 If there had been evidence that these changes had affected underlying, or core, inflation, the Bank would have considered it necessary to respond."
0,xbos xfld 1 The downward revision to the assumption for potential output growth also dampens future activity.

0,"xbos xfld 1 Yield spreads on most euro-area peripheral sovereign bonds have narrowed, reflecting signs of recovery in euro-area macroeconomic conditions and progress on reforms."
0,"xbos xfld 1 The impact of these developments on the demand for Canadian goods and services is causing changes in the composition of activity, employment, and capital spending among the various sectors of the economy, as well as major adjustments by many firms."
0,"xbos xfld 1 On the demand side, there is the possibility that continued robust growth of US demand for Canadian exports at a time of strong domestic demand could increase inflation pressures in Canada."
0,xbos xfld 1 The prices of non-energy commodities have risen further in recent months.

0,"xbos xfld 1 In Japan, economic momentum appears to be picking up more rapidly than was assumed, as strengthening demand in the rest of Asia provides a boost to Japanese exports."
0,"xbos xfld 1 While production also declined in commodity-producing industries during the first quarter, this largely reflected temporary production disruptions at an oil sands facility, the impact of adverse weather conditions on oil and gas drilling, and reduced foreign demand for lumber."
0,xbos xfld 1 The Bank expects net exports to provide greater support to the Canadian economic expansion over the projection horizon.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Real GDP growth averaged about 4 per cent over this period, supported by significant monetary and fiscal stimulus, a weaker yen, and improved confidence."

0,xbos xfld 1 Prices should begin to recover later on as the global economy gains strength.
0,"xbos xfld 1 The timing and magnitude of policy rate increases in both countries had been widely expected in financial markets, so that most of the rise in 90-day commercial paper rates occurred prior to the central bank actions."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Net exports are expected to remain a source of weakness, owing to sluggish foreign demand and ongoing competitiveness challenges, including the persistent strength of the Canadian dollar."
0,"xbos xfld 1 The significant overhang of unoccupied dwellings, as well as homes in the foreclosure pipeline, continues to restrain new construction and limit upward pressure on prices."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Economic activity in Canada is currently supported by the lower Canadian dollar and the ongoing low interest rates, which are continuing to help offset headwinds that include the impact of uncertainty and weak global demand."

0,"xbos xfld 1 In Japan, the recovery is projected to proceed largely as expected in the April Report, with net exports remaining the main driver of growth."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Against this background, the Bank has reduced its target for the overnight rate by a total of 50 basis points since the April Report, bringing it to 2.75 per cent."
0,xbos xfld 1 Reductions in the Bank's policy interest rate in January and July 2015 contributed importantly to these accommodative financial conditions.
0,"xbos xfld 1 In our analysis, the balance of forces continues to point to upward pressure on the core rate of inflation."
0,"xbos xfld 1 The European Central Bank, the Bank of England, and the Reserve Bank of Australia have all raised their respective policy rates, and financial markets expect further policy tightening in 2006 and early 2007."

0,"xbos xfld 1 Interest rates on high-yield corporate debt issued in US dollars are currently at an all-time low, reflecting robust demand and an increased appetite for risk."
0,xbos xfld 1 A modest appreciation of China's real exchange rate and the government's announced plan to boost household spending are expected to support a gradual rotation of demand away from exports and investment and toward consumption.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Aggregate demand, output, and employment grew more rapidly than expected, while core inflation remained low, below projected levels."
0,xbos xfld 1 Growth in household borrowing remains strong despite some deceleration thus far in 2008.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Growth is estimated to have weakened significantly in the fourth quarter, however, reflecting the removal of certain fiscal incentives supporting household spending and the recent appreciation of the yen."
0,"xbos xfld 1 However, the Bank's base-case scenario is predicated on existing trade arrangements over the projection horizon."
0,xbos xfld 1 Growth of business credit has fallen slightly below its historical average.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Some other US assets, including real estate investment trusts, high-yield corporate debt and municipal bonds, have registered larger declines in prices."

0,"xbos xfld 1 Non-commodity exports such as machinery and equipment, consumer goods (excluding automobiles), and services are also expected to strengthen gradually, but at a slower pace than other export sectors."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Structural factors, such as supply-side bottlenecks and excessive regulatory hurdles, also help account for the modest growth in these economies."
0,xbos xfld 1 The pickup in CPI-common since the beginning of 2018 reflects in part the impact of the recent minimum wage increases.
0,"xbos xfld 1 The global economy continues to expand, but at a somewhat slower pace than was expected in the April Report."
0,"xbos xfld 1 While risks to the inflation outlook remain elevated, the Bank judges that they are roughly balanced over the projection horizon."
0,"xbos xfld 1 As well, prices in the housing and service sectors increased at a slightly higher rate than expected."
0,"xbos xfld 1 With the modest downward revision to the growth outlook through to mid-2003, the Bank's best judgment is for a small amount of excess supply in the near term, which will be taken up as output growth moves above capacity growth in the second half of 2003."
0,"xbos xfld 1 However, here again, the impact on core inflation appears to be decreasing from a peak of about half a percentage point observed in the fall of 1995."
0,xbos xfld 1 Inflation is anticipated to continue to be close to 2 per cent.
0,xbos xfld 1 The timing and magnitude of these respective adjustments in productive capacity in the two sectors will determine potential output growth and economic activity over the medium term.

0,xbos xfld 1 The growth of potential output is projected to remain roughly stable over the 2014-17 period.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Following a particularly weak first quarter, growth in China picked up strongly in the second and third quarters, largely because of an improvement in net exports."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Together, these factors led to volatility in Canadian financial markets and several episodes of sharp downward pressure on the Canadian dollar."
0,xbos xfld 1 The Bank of Japan and the Bank of England have expanded their asset-purchase programs.
0,"xbos xfld 1 This projection for business investment is consistent with the Bank's autumn Business Outlook Survey, which showed that investment intentions remain strong, albeit slightly less so than in previous surveys, as some firms indicated a more cautious approach to their capital spending plans and a possible postponement of projects, given the uncertainty in the current environment."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Spending on items other than durable goods and housing continued to expand at a fairly robust pace, moving the savings rate to a record post-war low."
0,"xbos xfld 1 However, many commodity prices continue to outstrip earlier expectations, and this has altered the outlook for global and domestic inflation."
0,"xbos xfld 1 However, the recent declines in commodity prices and the terms of trade are forecast to have a modest negative effect on investment."
0,"xbos xfld 1 In contrast, business investment has increased, but by less than expected, despite strong corporate balance sheets."
0,"xbos xfld 1 In contrast, production by members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries could increase faster than expected as the previous agreement to reduce output expires."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Expectations for average inflation over the next two years, as reported in the Bank's most recent Business Outlook Survey, continue to show inflation expectations concentrated within the Bank's inflation-control range."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Nevertheless, there are still significant risks and uncertainties facing the global economy."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Over the medium term, the fundamental focus of monetary policy remains on keeping the trend of inflation inside the Bank's target range of 1 to 3 per cent."
0,"xbos xfld 1 (The overall national savings rate has, however, shown a rising trend since 1992.)"
0,xbos xfld 1 The pace of growth is anticipated to slow from 2 1/4 per cent to 1 1/2 per cent by 2020 as capacity constraints intensify and monetary policy stimulus is gradually withdrawn.
0,"xbos xfld 1 In view of recent developments, growth in the major European economies in 2001 is expected to slow to around 1.5 per cent on an average annual basis, while economic activity in Japan is expected to decline by about 0.5 per cent."
0,"xbos xfld 1 As well, Canadian shipments of commodities from high-cost sites may be further cut back until commodity prices recover significantly."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Moreover, Canada's investment income account deteriorated as net dividend payments rose considerably, and interest payments on foreign-currency debt increased."
0,xbos xfld 1 The acute uncertainties have resulted in volatile prices for all types of financial assets around the world.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Despite higher long-term interest rates, financial conditions in Canada remain accommodative, given the considerable monetary stimulus currently in place."
0,xbos xfld 1 Oil prices are now lower than current full-cycle break-even costs for many projects.
0,xbos xfld 1 The positive contribution of external demand to the expansion of the Canadian economy should continue in the first half of 1996.
0,"xbos xfld 1 On the upside, reduced investment in new production capacity is expected to constrain future supply growth, while oil demand is anticipated to be supported by stronger global activity."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Inflation has been weaker than expected, owing in large part to temporary factors."
0,"xbos xfld 1 The Bank continues to project, however, that the recovery in exports will be subdued relative to earlier global recoveries, with the higher level of the Canadian dollar assumed in this projection adding to long-standing competitiveness challenges."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Nonetheless, the Bank is still projecting a rebound to above-potential growth in 2010, albeit with a lower estimate of potential output growth."
0,xbos xfld 1 Both of these stock markets fell more than 10 per cent in the 10 days following 11 September but subsequently recovered by a substantial amount.
0,"xbos xfld 1 However, the effects of the negative factors weighing on the resource sector will become less intense, and the drag on overall GDP growth is expected to wane over 2016."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Last November, the anticipated slowing in US economic growth in response to earlier increases in interest rates and persistently higher energy prices appeared to be underway."
0,"xbos xfld 1 As of March 1997, core inflation was 1.7 per cent compared with a recent low of 1.2 per cent in September 1996."
0,"xbos xfld 1 After five successive quarters of being a drag on growth, inventory investment is expected to contribute positively in the second half."
0,"xbos xfld 1 In addition, there has been a rapid rise in electricity rates (included in the core measure)."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Household spending has remained flat, reflecting weak income growth and concerns about employment prospects."
0,xbos xfld 1 US corporations have strong balance sheets and can obtain market financing at a very low cost.
0,"xbos xfld 1 In contrast, housing investment began to decline from historically high levels."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Overall, in the first half of the year, the Canadian economy grew at a faster pace than anticipated."
0,"xbos xfld 1 The Bank's base-case projection now sees the Canadian economy contracting through to the third quarter of 2009 (one quarter longer than in the January Update), with real GDP dropping by 3.0 per cent this year on an annual average basis."
0,"xbos xfld 1 While the strategic direction of policy is thus clear, taking measured steps in that direction raises three issues: the timing of policy actions; the amount of adjustment to monetary conditions required; and the extent to which stimulus will be reduced as a result of movements in short-term interest rates as opposed to a strengthening of the Canadian dollar."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Consumer spending is expected to grow solidly over the projection period, reflecting further gains in real disposable income and increases in household net worth."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Also, short-term interest rates rose (the 90-day commercial paper rate nearing 5 per cent), even though the Bank of Canada was holding the band for the overnight interest rate at 4.5 to 5.0 per cent."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Falling equity prices, lower employment growth, and high energy prices have also caused sharp declines in consumer confidence and reduced consumption growth."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Growth nevertheless remains somewhat above that of potential output, reflecting a gradual broadening of the recovery."
0,"xbos xfld 1 At the same time, however, it has been supported by strengthening commodity markets and the improving current account of the balance of payments, as well as by the strong fundamentals of the Canadian economy."
0,xbos xfld 1 The recent weakness in business investment could reflect more persistent structural factors.
0,"xbos xfld 1 However, economic activity in Japan could pick up modestly by about 1 per cent in 2003, aided by the US recovery and easier monetary conditions."
0,xbos xfld 1 Large output gaps and the absence of wage pressure have kept underlying inflation in the major economies subdued.
0,"xbos xfld 1 As a result, the impact on year-over-year inflation should dissipate by mid-2016."
0,xbos xfld 1 Growth is expected to slow to 2.2 per cent in 2018 and to 1.6 per cent in 2019.
0,"xbos xfld 1 At the same time, growth prospects have softened in a number of emerging-market economies - the main engine of global growth over the past several years."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Settlements in the automotive sector averaged 3.5 per cent, while all other private sector settlements averaged 1.5 per cent."
0,"xbos xfld 1 As in the January Report, the Bank expects changes to the federal government's housing finance policy to continue to dampen housing activity."
0,"xbos xfld 1 US shale drilling has also expanded by less than anticipated, reflecting higher costs and pipeline bottlenecks."
0,"xbos xfld 1 The markets for securitized instruments remain severely impaired, and access to credit has continued to tighten for households and businesses in many countries, as indicated by surveys of senior loan officers."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Even so, since mid-1998 the unemployment rate has decreased by 1.2 percentage points."
0,xbos xfld 1 The boost to income from a larger population is more than offset by the negative consequences of weaker terms of trade.
0,xbos xfld 1 Prospects for inflation are little changed.
0,xbos xfld 1 The Bank estimates that economic growth rebounded to 2.0 per cent in the third quarter as the temporary factors that held back net exports in the second quarter unwound.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Nonetheless, prices in Vancouver remain elevated, and resale activity and housing starts continue to be robust in the Greater Toronto Area."
0,"xbos xfld 1 However, the recent strength in exports could indicate that the effect of the dollar's depreciation is more positive."
0,"xbos xfld 1 In the first quarter of 2013, household spending failed to contribute materially to real GDP growth for the first time since early 2009, since consumption rose only modestly and residential investment declined for the third consecutive quarter."
0,"xbos xfld 1 The estimated effective rate for businesses has increased by about 50 basis points since early June, in line with business prime rates."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Furthermore, anecdotal evidence continues to suggest that competition in the Canadian retail marketplace remains intense, with strong consumer resistance to price increases."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Household spending is expected to remain high relative to GDP as households add to their debt burden, which remains the biggest domestic risk."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Nonetheless, the tightening was less generalized and more industry-specific than in previous quarters."
0,xbos xfld 1 Other measures of the trend rate of inflation that the Bank follows also continued to be below 2 per cent.
0,"xbos xfld 1 In Europe, the economic expansion remains solid."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Job gains have averaged close to 200,000 per month so far in 2015, and the unemployment rate has fallen."
0,"xbos xfld 1 While money market rates had already largely incorporated this move, the Canadian dollar firmed somewhat further."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Inflationary pressures appear to be building in China, with higher prices for basic commodities such as food and energy."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Capital outflows seem to have moderated, partly reflecting last year's tightening of capital controls."
0,"xbos xfld 1 While the nature and timing of fiscal policy changes in the United States are unknown, the base-case projection for the US economy embeds an element of fiscal expansion, which boosts the level of GDP by about 0.5 per cent by the end of 2018."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Securitized markets nevertheless remain impaired, despite a number of private and public sector initiatives under way to revive them."
0,xbos xfld 1 And the contingency arrangements mentioned above should prevent significant movement in interest rates in response to year-end pressures.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Overall, US economic activity is expected to strengthen as fiscal headwinds dissipate and household deleveraging ends."
0,xbos xfld 1 This would suggest the possible need for further easing in monetary conditions over the medium term.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Available indicators point to slower, but still solid, growth in the second quarter."
0,xbos xfld 1 External demand for Canada's exports remains weak.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Taking into account the various indicators of capacity pressures and the uncertainty surrounding any point estimate, the Bank judges that the amount of excess capacity in the third quarter was between 1/2 and 1 1/2 per cent."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Global prices for crude oil, as measured by the Brent benchmark, have fluctuated within a relatively narrow range since the October Report, and continue to be boosted by tensions in the Middle East."
0,"xbos xfld 1 In a more adverse scenario, the process of globalization - and notably the development of global value chains, which has underpinned world growth in recent decades - could go into reverse."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Given the effects of the past and recent appreciation of the Canadian dollar, the Bank projects real GDP growth to average a little less than 3 per cent in 2005 and a little more than 3 per cent in 2006, with a somewhat larger drag from net exports than projected in the October Report, but stronger growth in domestic demand."
0,"xbos xfld 1 In other oil-importing EMEs, growth is projected to average about 4 1/4 per cent over 2017-19."
0,xbos xfld 1 Labour productivity in the business sector actually fell by 1.3 per cent from the second quarter of 2007 to the second quarter of 2008.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Inflation is subsequently expected to remain close to 2 per cent, consistent with an economy operating close to potential output."
0,"xbos xfld 1 With accommodative financial conditions continuing to provide support, economic growth is projected to be sufficient to absorb excess capacity, although at a more gradual pace than anticipated in the July Report."
0,"xbos xfld 1 The 12-month rate of increase in the total CPI was 1.0 per cent in May, down from 1.5 per cent in February."
0,"xbos xfld 1 In addition, lumber prices have fallen, reflecting lower-than-expected US housing demand."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Overall, most businesses continue to characterize credit as easy or relatively easy to obtain."
0,"xbos xfld 1 On the upside, investment growth and inventory rebuilding in the United States may be stronger than expected, and the Chinese economy may not slow as much as projected."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Since the January Update, the Canadian dollar has averaged 100 cents US but more recently has been trading in a range of roughly 97 to 100 cents US."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Even allowing for the recent substitution of deposits into longer-term mutual funds, the Bank's indicator model for inflation using M2+ predicts core inflation of around 1 per cent or less for the next two quarters."
0,xbos xfld 1 The new data result in a more moderate rate of growth in 2001 and early 2002 than was previously estimated.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Given more momentum than generally expected in the economy and the Bank's estimate of close to 3 per cent growth in potential output for 1995, a further significant closing of the output gap by year-end seems likely."
0,"xbos xfld 1 The core rate of inflation, which has been above 2 per cent for the past year, was 2.2 per cent in August."
0,"xbos xfld 1 In addition, global demand for commodities should ease as a result of the slowing in world economic growth."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Excess demand in many of these economies, coupled with past increases in commodity prices, is creating broader global inflationary pressures."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Business fixed investment continued to grow at a rapid pace, reflecting higher spending on both machinery and equipment and non-residential structures."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Over the last six months, rates on medium - and long-term government bonds have fallen sharply in both Canada and the United States."
0,"xbos xfld 1 In the third quarter, real GDP grew at an annual rate of 1.7 per cent."
0,"xbos xfld 1 At this pace, capacity pressures will intensify."
0,xbos xfld 1 The fluctuations in the MCI have resulted largely from changes in the exchange rate.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Meanwhile, activity in the rest of the economy is expanding and is expected to be the main source of growth over the next few years."
0,"xbos xfld 1 The lack of growth in productivity in the second half of 1995 resulted partly from the largely unanticipated slowing in demand towards year-end, since firms tend not to adjust their labour inputs fully to adverse demand shocks in the short run."
0,xbos xfld 1 Intentions to increase investment remain weak among firms in the more investment-intensive manufacturing sector.
0,xbos xfld 1 Consumer spending is projected to grow solidly over the projection period as a result of ongoing gains in both real disposable income and household net worth.
0,"xbos xfld 1 The assumption in the Bank's base-case projection is that it will subtract around 0.3 percentage points from core inflation in 2014, with the effects largely dissipating by around the middle of 2015."
0,xbos xfld 1 It also reduces the likelihood of a more adverse scenario that could cause stress in the financial system.
0,"xbos xfld 1 However, the demand for credit stemming from the solid growth in business investment continues to be tempered by the historically high cash position of non-financial firms."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Despite this recent pickup, continued weak growth in M2++ points to a downside risk for inflation."
0,"xbos xfld 1 But there is some risk that the economy could grow more rapidly and move into a more persistent excess-demand situation next year, leading to further upward pressure on inflation."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Moreover, in 2015, government spending is expected to resume growing on an annual basis for the first time in five years."
0,"xbos xfld 1 The decline in this effect has been clearly evident in the prices of motor vehicles, where the year-over-year rate of increase in Canada over that in the United States fell from 2.9 percentage points in January 1995 to 2.1 percentage points in February 1996."
0,"xbos xfld 1 In particular, concerns about a further substantial deterioration of the US economy have lessened since the May Report."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Government spending is not projected to contribute to growth in 2012 and to contribute only modestly thereafter, in line with plans to consolidate spending by federal and provincial governments."
0,"xbos xfld 1 As a result, total CPI inflation is still expected to converge to core inflation at the 2 per cent target by the middle of 2012."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Job gains have averaged close to 250,000 per month through 2014; the unemployment rate has fallen; and other labour market indicators, including the Bank's labour market indicator for the United States, have improved."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Non-commodity export growth is expected to be slightly stronger in 2017-18, but the level of non-commodity exports remains somewhat lower at the end of 2018."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Borrowing costs for banks have decreased since the October Report, owing to the reduction in the policy interest rate and significant ongoing efforts to provide liquidity to the Canadian financial system."
0,"xbos xfld 1 More generally, above-average inflation since the beginning of the year has been concentrated in categories that tend to exhibit low inflation persistence - hence, inflation rates in these categories are expected to decrease in the near term."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Consumer spending on durable goods, particularly motor vehicles, grew at a healthy pace, as a result of low interest rates, pent-up demand, and continued marked gains in employment."
0,"xbos xfld 1 However, it is impossible to fully quantify the implications of this shift without more clarity about the actual measures and their timing."
0,"xbos xfld 1 In this regard, the October Consensus Economics forecasts for total CPI inflation were 1.1 per cent in 2013 and 1.8 per cent in 2014."
0,xbos xfld 1 This means that the Bank must place increasing weight on a range of indicators to assess the degree of pressure on the economy's production capacity.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Given structural changes in the oil market, particularly as a result of the US shale supply, there is much uncertainty regarding future prices."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Since the April Report, the prices of many non-energy commodities have risen."
0,"xbos xfld 1 In response to the events of 11 September, the US dollar initially weakened against major world currencies, continuing the depreciating trend that had begun in June."
0,"xbos xfld 1 In late summer, the turbulence in global markets intensified as a result of developments in Russia, particularly the decision by the Russian authorities to unilaterally declare a debt moratorium."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Economic activity was also adversely affected by the August blackout in Ontario and by the closure of international borders to imports of Canadian cattle, beef, and related products after the discovery of one case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy last May."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Early information suggests that the current account position is likely to have moved back into surplus in the first quarter, following both a rebound in the real trade balance and a further increase in the terms of trade."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Global credit markets, in contrast, are still fragile, with improvements largely confined to short-term funding markets, while longer-term spreads remain elevated."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Although their investment intentions indicate plans to boost spending, respondents to the Business Outlook Survey are increasingly concerned about the ongoing NAFTA renegotiations and rising protectionism more generally."
0,"xbos xfld 1 However, stronger-than-expected growth in capital spending by energy producers, based on recent investment intentions, should more than offset that negative effect by 2006."
0,xbos xfld 1 Data for the third quarter of 2017 show that capacity utilization rates were rising across most industries.
0,"xbos xfld 1 At the same time, however, with a significant improvement in the growth of labour productivity, the projected year-to-year increase in unit labour costs over this period, should remain around 2 per cent."
0,"xbos xfld 1 At the same time, further marked gains in investment in machinery and equipment, combined with the strength in the Canadian dollar, should stimulate imports."
0,"xbos xfld 1 The latest futures curves suggest that crude oil prices will decline by roughly 11 per cent through 2015, consistent with a rise in global production, modest growth in demand and an expected decline in the risk premium associated with tensions in the Middle East."
0,xbos xfld 1 Such reduction would need to be carefully considered.
0,"xbos xfld 1 In the near term, growth will continue to be held back by tighter financial conditions and heightened uncertainty, as well as by persistent supply constraints."
0,xbos xfld 1 Such growth would return the economy close to its production potential by the third quarter of next year.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Consistent with the outlook for global growth, the price index for non-energy commodities is expected to decline somewhat over the projection horizon but still be higher than was anticipated in the July Update."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Residential investment has rebounded in recent quarters, albeit from a very depressed level."
0,"xbos xfld 1 As anticipated in the July Report, core CPI inflation rose to 1.9 per cent in the third quarter from 1.6 per cent in the second quarter."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Housing investment is expected to be little changed, on balance, following strong increases in recent years."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Although signs of recovery are apparent, securitization markets are still operating at a fraction of their pre-crisis levels and credit conditions at banks are still relatively tight, owing to ongoing deleveraging."
0,xbos xfld 1 Both the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan have continued to implement unconventional monetary policy measures to support growth.
0,"xbos xfld 1 The estimated impact in 2012 is smaller than was anticipated in the October Report, given improved prospects for the extension of the payroll tax cuts and unemployment insurance benefits that were scheduled to expire at the end of 2011."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Simple indicator models, based solely on the growth rate of the narrow monetary aggregates, suggest that growth will be within that range."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Notwithstanding the easing in core inflation, the Canadian economy continues to operate above its production capacity."
0,"xbos xfld 1 The level of GDP is lower throughout the projection horizon, however, as a result of the weakness in the first quarter of this year."
0,"xbos xfld 1 While US oil production peaked in April 2015, International Energy Agency forecasts suggest that global production is expected to continue to exceed demand until at least the second half of 2016."
0,"xbos xfld 1 There have, however, been signs of improvement in financial conditions more recently, partly because of interest rate cuts by both the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of Canada."
0,xbos xfld 1 Further gains in real incomes should contribute to solid growth in consumer spending.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Consumer price inflation will increase in the short term, however, reflecting the rapid increase in gasoline prices in recent months and the impact of the rise in food prices associated with the drought that affected vast areas of US farmland."
0,xbos xfld 1 This robust growth is widespread across both household and business deposits.
0,"xbos xfld 1 For example, five-year fixed mortgage rates have increased by about 50 basis points since the July Report."
0,"xbos xfld 1 In contrast, the economies of Brazil, Russia and Turkey are much weaker, partly as a result of political or geopolitical tensions."
0,"xbos xfld 1 This being said, significant upside and downside risks to the Bank's projection for inflation remain."
0,xbos xfld 1 Chart 18 and Chart 19 depict the 50 per cent and 90 per cent confidence bands for year-over-year core and total CPI inflation from the first quarter of 2010 to the end of 2011.
0,"xbos xfld 1 This is in part because the price increases in the sectors responsible for the pickup are currently above their historical averages and tend to exhibit low inflation persistence, suggesting that they will subside quickly going forward."
0,"xbos xfld 1 The March Consensus Economics forecast for total CPI inflation for 2015 is 0.9 per cent, down slightly from January, while the forecast for 2016 has remained unchanged, at 2.1 per cent."
0,"xbos xfld 1 At the same time, persistently low investment in new oil projects since 2014 has significantly reduced prospects for supply growth."
0,xbos xfld 1 The growth of aggregate demand in Canada should begin to strengthen appreciably towards year-end and through 2004.
0,"xbos xfld 1 On the other hand, Statistics Canada's measure of capacity utilization in the non-farm, goods-producing sector indicated that pressure on production capacity was somewhat below average in the second quarter of 2007."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Compared with expectations in the July Report, the larger population than previously assumed has a positive effect."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Canada's total exports increased moderately in the first half of 2007, with strong gains in exports of energy commodities and products."
0,xbos xfld 1 This is slightly less than estimated in the January Report.
0,xbos xfld 1 Such developments have contributed to the decrease in the yields on the long-term government bonds of major industrialized countries since mid-year.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Real GDP increased at an annual rate of 2.7 per cent in the first half of 2005, faster than expected at the time of the July Update."
0,xbos xfld 1 These factors also affect firms' choice of location for production: exporting firms have been able to respond to increases in export demand through their foreign facilities located close to the source of demand rather than exclusively through Canadian exports.
0,xbos xfld 1 Volatility in the equity market may also dampen consumer optimism.
0,xbos xfld 1 Consumer price index inflation has risen in recent months by more than was anticipated in the July Report.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Since some of the key volatile components excluded from the core measure are more sensitive to exchange rate movements, the pass-through to total CPI inflation is estimated to be larger, at about 0.3 to 0.4 percentage points."
0,xbos xfld 1 Larger-than-expected increases in household income and foreign demand provided additional momentum in the final quarter of 2009 and the first quarter of 2010.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Core inflation has fallen further in recent months, in part due to temporary factors."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Over the projection horizon, the composition of demand in Canada is expected to shift away from government and household expenditures towards business investment and net exports."
0,xbos xfld 1 A weaker near-term outlook for the US economy has curbed the near-term prospects for Canadian exports and growth.
0,"xbos xfld 1 A short, decisive conflict, or an early non-military resolution of the dispute, could reduce geopolitical uncertainties fairly rapidly."
0,xbos xfld 1 Staff estimate that there is a 50 per cent probability that the output gap in the second quarter of 1998 was between and 2 per cent.
0,xbos xfld 1 The result of the UK referendum triggered a sharp but orderly repricing of a number of asset classes in global financial markets.
0,xbos xfld 1 The knock-on effects in Canada from weaker US demand and financial market turbulence would have significant consequences for our exports and for domestic economic activity.
0,xbos xfld 1 Inflation should then return to the 2 per cent target and remain there.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Gains in productivity (output per person-hour) were particularly impressive during 1994, as firms restructured their operations and as the economic expansion gained strength (Parker 1995)."
0,xbos xfld 1 Real GDP growth in 2001 is still expected to be in a range between 2 and 3 per cent.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Indeed, the price of oil is currently well above the levels in the base-case scenarios of both the April Report and the last Update."
0,xbos xfld 1 The main risks to the outlook for inflation are those identified in the October Monetary Policy Report.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Overall, growth is projected to remain at around 1 per cent over 2017-19, in line with expectations in the January Report."
0,"xbos xfld 1 This effect will be gradually offset, however, by growth in the non-resource sector, which will help to support labour demand and income and thus household expenditures."
0,xbos xfld 1 This reflects the divergent economic developments between North America and the major overseas countries.
0,"xbos xfld 1 On the downside, prospects for US demand for Canadian goods and services could be weaker than currently assumed, particularly if the expected recovery in US investment spending is delayed."
0,"xbos xfld 1 At the time of the April Report, both core and total CPI inflation were well above the 2 per cent target."
0,"xbos xfld 1 As a result of the more severe, synchronized nature of the global downturn, the recession in Canada is even deeper than anticipated."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Growth in the narrow monetary aggregates continued to rebound in the fourth quarter, reflecting some increase in liquidity preference, with heightened uncertainty and low alternative rates of return likely playing a role."
0,"xbos xfld 1 A large part of the downward revision to growth in 2010 is due to the lower assumed growth rate of potential output, relative to the January Update."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Based on available indicators, it appears that real GDP grew by about 3.2 per cent in the first quarter of 2006, driven by many of the same factors that were evident through the second half of last year."
0,xbos xfld 1 Growth in M2++ has continued to be boosted by net contributions to mutual funds.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Bearing in mind this uncertainty, in its base-case projection, the Bank expects that in the first half of this year real GDP growth will slow to about 1 1/2 per cent and the degree of excess capacity will widen somewhat."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Over the projection horizon, real GDP growth is projected to average around 1.7 per cent per year, supported by the continued rebuilding of infrastructure."
0,xbos xfld 1 Investment in housing is then expected to ease slightly through 2007 and 2008.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Core inflation is expected to increase gradually over coming quarters, reaching 2 per cent by the middle of 2013 as the current small degree of slack in the economy is gradually absorbed, the growth of labour compensation stays moderate and inflation expectations remain well anchored."
0,xbos xfld 1 The Canadian dollar strengthened somewhat against other major currencies over this period.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Meanwhile, the resilience in employment outside the resource sector is likely to continue to support household expenditures."
0,xbos xfld 1 The Bank's projection assumes that the crisis in the euro area will continue to be contained.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Thus, the US current account deficit, which is largely matched by surpluses in Asia and in oil-exporting countries, starts to gradually unwind in 2007."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Since October, the Canadian dollar has depreciated against the US dollar, reflecting the drop in oil prices and the widespread strength of the US currency, but is little changed against the currencies of Canada's other major trading partners."
0,xbos xfld 1 Total CPI inflation is expected to remain below 2 per cent through 2016 as disinflationary pressures associated with weak consumer energy prices and excess capacity in the Canadian economy more than offset the inflationary effects of exchange rate pass-through.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Based on the latest futures curves, WCS prices are expected to hover around current levels over the projection horizon, with the gap between WTI and WCS prices expected to narrow to about US$20 per barrel."
0,"xbos xfld 1 In the base-case projection, the low oil price assumption leads to a persistent shift of investment and jobs away from energy-related sectors and regions, reversing some of the earlier structural adjustment in the Canadian economy."
0,xbos xfld 1 Canada's overall financial conditions continue to improve and to be more favourable than those in most other advanced economies.
0,"xbos xfld 1 In April, we projected that Canadian economic growth would average 2.5 per cent in the first three quarters of the year and that core inflation would fall to 2 per cent by early 2004."
0,"xbos xfld 1 First, the weaker US economic outlook means that the projection for net exports and, to a lesser extent, investment has been revised down."
0,"xbos xfld 1 For the next year or so, total CPI will continue to be importantly affected by recent developments in the market for crude oil, natural gas, gasoline, and heating oil."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Based on an analysis of all the indicators of capacity pressures, the size of the output gap is judged to be slightly larger than the conventional measure suggests."
0,xbos xfld 1 The current weakness in trend labour productivity growth reflects the declines in investment.
0,xbos xfld 1 The relatively strong capitalization of Canadian financial institutions should mean that credit availability will remain more robust in Canada than in other major markets.
0,"xbos xfld 1 In the United States, core inflation, which excludes energy and food prices, has continued to edge up."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Based on the indicators in Chart 7, as well as on labour compensation per person-hour in the business sector, the underlying rate of increase in the average wage appears to have edged up to just over 3 per cent."
0,"xbos xfld 1 In the euro area, economic growth is expected to be about 1 per cent, on an average annual basis, in 2003 (weaker than our October projection) and to rise to about 2.25 per cent in 2004."
0,xbos xfld 1 Stabilization of the global financial system is a precondition for economic recovery.
0,"xbos xfld 1 In Japan, activity related to reconstruction helped boost the growth of real GDP to 5.6 per cent in the third quarter of 2011."
0,xbos xfld 1 Moderate to strong growth is expected in these economies during the second half of the year.
0,"xbos xfld 1 With further increases in supplies and ongoing reductions in stocks by users, prices for pulp and paper may continue to decline over the near term."
0,"xbos xfld 1 In contrast, another broad-based measure, the year-over-year increase in labour income per person-hour, was relatively stable in 1999 - within a range of 1 to 2 per cent."
0,xbos xfld 1 Near-term growth in exports is expected to be dampened by weak activity in a number of advanced economies before picking up in mid-2013.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Unusually large grain harvests and increased exports of metals, crude oil, and pulp from resource-rich countries were largely responsible for increased commodity supplies."
0,"xbos xfld 1 There is, however, a wide range of possible outcomes, both stronger and weaker, around this base-case view."
0,"xbos xfld 1 In addition, the housing market is anticipated to slow somewhat in light of elevated household debt and higher longer-term borrowing costs resulting from the projected gradual rise in global long-term yields."
0,xbos xfld 1 Past exchange rate declines appear to be adding about 0.1 to 0.2 percentage points to core inflation at this time.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Economic expansion in the major European countries was weaker than expected during the second half of 1996, while the pace of spending in Japan was somewhat more rapid than anticipated."
0,xbos xfld 1 The year-to-year rise in another wage indicator - hourly labour compensation from Statistics Canada's Productivity Accounts - decreased to just over 3 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2006.
0,"xbos xfld 1 First, longer-term expectations of inflation close to the middle of the inflation-control target range helped to hold core inflation up."
0,xbos xfld 1 Consumer spending is expected to grow at a solid pace throughout the projection horizon.
0,xbos xfld 1 International commodity prices are expected to recover somewhat in the second half of 1998.
0,"xbos xfld 1 At the end of April, one of the major risks identified in the last Monetary Policy Report was materializing."
0,xbos xfld 1 A number of firms cited the slow-growth environment as a factor driving their expectations.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Overall, fourth-quarter sales increased sharply, and firms reduced their inventories at a faster pace than in the third quarter, resulting in a further decline in the stock-to-sales ratio."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Based on a view of sustained domestic demand in the United States and accommodative monetary conditions in Canada, the Bank expects that both external and domestic demand will continue to contribute to an expanding Canadian economy over the next year."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Other European banks have faced some deterioration in wholesale funding conditions, reflecting their direct and indirect exposures to vulnerable sovereigns."
0,"xbos xfld 1 By convention, the Canadian dollar is assumed to be close to its recent average level of 79 cents over the projection horizon, compared with the 86 cents assumed in January."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Inflation pressures are expected to moderate over the projection horizon, however, in response to considerable excess capacity."
0,xbos xfld 1 Pressures on capacity could be greater and more prolonged than currently judged.
0,"xbos xfld 1 In particular, building materials, fabricated metal and non-metallic mineral products have posted robust growth in recent months."
0,xbos xfld 1 The output gap in the base-case projection is anticipated to close around the end of 2015.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Nonetheless, we anticipate increased demand pressures in the second half of 2003 and into 2004, following growth at slightly below potential in the first half of this year."
0,xbos xfld 1 The risks to the base-case projection remain balanced for 2006 and tilted to the downside through 2007 and beyond.
0,"xbos xfld 1 While stronger than in the advanced economies, real GDP growth in China and other emerging-market economies has slowed, exerting downward pressure on global commodity prices."
0,xbos xfld 1 Growth in US household spending is projected to be supported through 2012 by a measured improvement in the pace of job creation.
0,xbos xfld 1 There was also a further increase in core food prices in November.
0,"xbos xfld 1 During the first quarter it also became increasingly apparent that the momentum in the economy was still stronger than expected and, with the degree of slack diminishing rapidly, some tightening in monetary conditions was warranted on that score."
0,xbos xfld 1 M2++ continues to grow at a rate between 7 and 8 per cent - a rate that has been maintained for several years.
0,xbos xfld 1 Weaker investment in the oil and gas industry will also constrain investment demand in industries linked to the energy sector.
0,"xbos xfld 1 These developments included strong world economic growth, high and volatile energy prices, high price levels for many other commodities, declining prices for many manufactured goods, and the appreciation of the Canadian dollar."
0,xbos xfld 1 Both inflation and inflation expectations have declined more rapidly than the Bank had expected.
0,"xbos xfld 1 For Canada, the Bank's base-case projection is weaker for 2008 but somewhat stronger for 2009 than in the October Report."
0,xbos xfld 1 Significant policy easing has been introduced in Japan.
0,"xbos xfld 1 As a result, some limited progress in resolving global imbalances is expected over the projection horizon."
0,xbos xfld 1 Exports are expected to recover in response to the gradual improvement in external demand and the past depreciation of the Canadian dollar.
0,"xbos xfld 1 These difficulties have been heightened by a lack of liquidity, a widespread process of deleveraging by financial institutions, and the deteriorating outlook for the US economy."
0,xbos xfld 1 Core CPI inflation moderated to an average of 1.3 per cent in October and November from an average of 1.5 per cent in the third quarter and 2.0 per cent in the first half of 2012.
0,"xbos xfld 1 In contrast, borrowing costs for Canadian businesses have continued to fall in recent months, with firms benefiting from the recent sharp reduction in spreads."
0,"xbos xfld 1 The challenge for monetary policy over the remainder of this year and through 2003 is to help the economy move back to, and then sustain, levels of production at capacity by taking actions aimed at achieving the Bank's 2 per cent target for inflation control."
0,xbos xfld 1 Stronger demand in the United States would be transmitted to the Canadian economy through the trade channel and higher commodity prices.
0,xbos xfld 1 These spreads are expected to widen again because of transportation bottlenecks.
0,"xbos xfld 1 The improvement in financial conditions and economic activity, as well as higher commodity prices, should help boost business spending in 2010."
0,"xbos xfld 1 If household demand continues to recover and if retail stocks come into better balance in the second half of 1996, more of this discounting may end, leading to some increase in prices."
0,xbos xfld 1 This action should provide some support for the euro area over the coming year.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Increases in investment expenditures are particularly pronounced in oil and natural gas extraction, other mining activity, and in the manufacture of wood products."
0,xbos xfld 1 The persistent weakness in trend productivity growth also suggests a pace of GDP growth over the forecast horizon that is somewhat slower than previously anticipated.
0,"xbos xfld 1 As well, there is the risk of greater direct downward pressure on core goods prices related to the past appreciation of the Canadian dollar."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Since January, financial conditions have improved somewhat, as stock market gains and a lower overnight rate have partially offset continued higher yields on corporate bonds."
0,xbos xfld 1 Total CPI inflation over the next year is expected to be much higher than projected at the time of the April Report.
0,"xbos xfld 1 On the other hand, the year-over-year increase in new home prices rose a little further to 2.4 per cent in August, largely because of higher costs for labour and construction materials."
0,xbos xfld 1 fiscal authorities have introduced substantial stimulus packages to help offset the drop in domestic and foreign demand.
0,xbos xfld 1 Efforts to contain inflationary pressures appear to have been inhibited by the lack of flexibility in the country's exchange rate.
0,xbos xfld 1 Wage increases are expected to rise slightly through 2004.
0,xbos xfld 1 The clearest example of the exchange rate effect can be seen in motor vehicles.
0,"xbos xfld 1 The persistent strength of the Canadian dollar could create even greater headwinds for the Canadian economy, putting additional downward pressure on inflation through weaker­ than ­expected net exports and larger declines in import prices."
0,xbos xfld 1 The Bank of Canada raised its overnight target range once in November.
0,xbos xfld 1 Improved market access has contributed to a record amount of global long-term corporate bond issuance since the beginning of the year.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Firms have started to address their inventory problems, with widespread shutdowns in the automotive sector in particular."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Two, if demand conditions had delayed pass-through from the past depreciation, then the recent strengthening of demand could result in higher prices even in the absence of further depreciation."
0,xbos xfld 1 A modest further appreciation of their real exchange rates should also help to restrain export growth.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Similarly, effective borrowing rates for both households and businesses remain at or near historically low levels."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Sustained improvement over the medium term will require fiscal consolidation in the United States and several other advanced countries, together with policy-induced domestic demand growth and real exchange rate adjustment for surplus countries."
0,xbos xfld 1 The reallocation of investment and employment from the resource sector to the non-resource sector is progressing.
0,"xbos xfld 1 In most advanced economies, monetary policy is likely to remain stimulative for some time, but fiscal stimulus is expected to be neutral to negative over the coming year."
0,xbos xfld 1 This has pushed up the retail prices of both gasoline and fuel oil.
0,"xbos xfld 1 In contrast, banks in the euro area have tightened terms and conditions on business credit."
0,xbos xfld 1 Wage and price inflation in these economies should pick up over the projection horizon as above-potential growth continues.
0,"xbos xfld 1 CPI inflation is then expected to decline, reaching the 2 per cent target by early 2009."
0,xbos xfld 1 About one-third of the income gains associated with the commodity price increases since early 2002 have been reversed.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Third, global credit conditions are assumed to remain tighter."
0,xbos xfld 1 Two main factors have been driving recent movements in the dollar.
0,xbos xfld 1 The good inflation performance to date suggests that the amount of excess demand in the US economy at midyear was probably less than the Bank had previously estimated.
0,"xbos xfld 1 More recent monthly data suggest that global output picked up in the third quarter, partly reflecting the impact of the temporary fiscal measures that have been adopted in most major economies, as well as a short-term boost to growth from a turn in the inventory cycle."
0,xbos xfld 1 Failure to contain the crisis in Europe is the most serious risk facing the global and Canadian economies.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Greater headwinds from EMEs, tighter financial conditions and below-target inflation have pushed back market expectations for when normalization of US monetary policy will begin."
0,xbos xfld 1 The first-quarter run-up in crude oil prices (which was partially reversed in April) is not expected to significantly affect the core CPI.
0,"xbos xfld 1 More fundamentally, the ongoing slack in product markets has continued to put downward pressure on inflation."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Growth in household spending has been robust, boosted by low interest rates."
0,xbos xfld 1 The latest data provide a more optimistic assessment of the current level and prospective growth of potential output.
0,"xbos xfld 1 The Bank expects trend growth in household credit to moderate further, with the debt-to-income ratio stabilizing near current levels."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Nevertheless, as both foreign and domestic demand increase, industries outside the resource sector will need to invest to expand production."
0,xbos xfld 1 Inflation in Canada is close to the 2 per cent target.
0,"xbos xfld 1 However, demographic factors, primarily the aging population, are expected to result in a slowdown in the growth rate of trend labour input and to largely offset these other effects."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Nevertheless, the average annual growth rate in 2005 should be significantly lower than in 2004, owing to the low starting point."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Reflecting in part the considerable monetary policy accommodation in place, the supply and price of credit for businesses and households in Canada remain very stimulative, continuing to provide important support to the economic expansion."
0,"xbos xfld 1 The timing and speed of the recovery in other industrialized economies reflect past and current policy actions, as well as the state of their banking systems."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Household expenditures are now projected to grow relatively modestly, as lower commodity prices and heightened volatility in financial markets weigh on the incomes, wealth and confidence of Canadian households."
0,"xbos xfld 1 The outlook for investment continues to be supported by the strong aggregate financial position of Canadian firms, favourable credit conditions, relatively high commodity prices and the strong Canadian dollar, as well as the impetus to improve productivity amid heightened pressures to become more competitive."
0,"xbos xfld 1 The stronger economic growth in the first half of the year means that, at mid-year, the level of activity and the estimated degree of pressure on production capacity are marginally higher than projected in the April Report."
0,xbos xfld 1 Further upward movement in crude oil prices since early November is expected to push the rate of increase in the total CPI close to 3 per cent in coming months.
0,"xbos xfld 1 While geopolitical uncertainty has waned, growing imbalances in the global economy pose their own challenges."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Two other statistical measures of the trend rate of inflation, the CPIX and CPIW, continue to be close to core inflation."
0,"xbos xfld 1 In some countries, such as the United States and Japan, where policy rates are close to zero, monetary authorities are resorting to other means of credit easing."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Bond yields have increased more in Canada than in the United States, and negative spreads have largely disappeared."
0,xbos xfld 1 Consumption growth improved after a weak first quarter.
0,"xbos xfld 1 However, since the unemployment rate is expected to remain elevated and inflation pressures subdued, most members of the Federal Open Market Committee do not expect the first increase in the policy interest rate to occur until 2015."
0,"xbos xfld 1 In general, with historically low price increases and sales volumes, markets in Eastern Canada appear to show signs consistent with a soft landing."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Despite considerable monetary accommodation, growth is expected to remain modest through 2016, as consumption demand continues to be restrained by weak real disposable household incomes and another VAT increase planned for 2015."
0,"xbos xfld 1 And total CPI inflation has been running above 2 per cent, largely reflecting tightness in global energy markets that is also partly related to the strong economic growth in Asia."
0,xbos xfld 1 Recent data also indicate significantly less momentum in short term growth in Europe and Japan than previously assumed.
0,xbos xfld 1 Financial conditions overall have been broadly stable.
0,"xbos xfld 1 In particular, capital spending is projected to start to strengthen, and demand by households should be sustained."
0,"xbos xfld 1 On 8 December 2009 and 19 January 2010, the Bank reaffirmed its conditional commitment to maintain its target for the overnight rate at its current level of 1/4 per cent until the end of the second quarter of 2010 in order to achieve the inflation target."
0,xbos xfld 1 Developments in Europe have also had an impact on bank lending conditions in the United States.
0,"xbos xfld 1 If gasoline prices were to remain elevated relative to oil prices, total CPI inflation would also be higher than in the base case."
0,xbos xfld 1 Underlying demographic demand and significantly improved affordability are expected to boost residential construction over the projection horizon.
0,xbos xfld 1 Interest rate increases in both countries had been widely expected in financial markets.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Equity markets have recovered substantially over the past three quarters, and firms have enjoyed greater access to capital markets, with global corporate bond issuance reaching record levels."
0,"xbos xfld 1 While this shift is expected to be successful, the process will be protracted and may involve some volatility."
0,"xbos xfld 1 The global economic outlook has been clouded by a high degree of uncertainty, accentuated most recently by the war in Iraq."
0,xbos xfld 1 Elevated commodity prices should continue to sustain the high level of investment in the resource sector in Canada and support Canadian incomes.
0,"xbos xfld 1 The Bank projects that the economy will expand slightly faster than potential output over 2018 and 2019, and then grow with potential."
0,"xbos xfld 1 For example, the structural estimate of the labour input gap is currently around -1 1/2 per cent."
0,"xbos xfld 1 While growth will be choppy in the near term as a result of unusual temporary factors, underlying momentum in the economy is expected to build into 2014."
0,"xbos xfld 1 The Bank's judgment is that underlying inflationary pressures remain muted, given the persistent slack in the economy and continued intense competition in the retail sector."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Several factors are, nevertheless, expected to moderate the expansion of demand over the course of this year."
0,"xbos xfld 1 This has been particularly true for oil, lumber, and nickel, where production constraints have also been a factor."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Capital expenditures by businesses rose rapidly in the first six months of this year, supported by further marked gains in profitability and high levels of confidence."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Indeed, the level of the FCI is now slightly above its 10-year average."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Yields on shorter-term bonds in both Canada and the United States have risen since the last Report, driven by higher policy rates and expectations of further increases."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Recent data suggest that both consumption and investment are continuing to rise at a robust pace, supported by the easing in monetary and fiscal policy and a reduction in uncertainty."
0,"xbos xfld 1 This situation reflected the general cyclical weakness of the world economy and commodity prices, as well as the uncertain international economic and political situation."
0,xbos xfld 1 Responses to business surveys suggest that a growing number of firms plan to raise wages over the next three months.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Credit spreads for the most affected sovereigns widened sharply, and the turbulence affected several euro-area countries."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Economic activity in the United States gathered momentum in the second quarter of this year owing to solid gains in household and business spending, as well as a sharp increase in federal defence outlays."
0,"xbos xfld 1 As a result, the price of oil is currently well above that in the base-case assumption used in the last Report."
0,xbos xfld 1 Temporary tax reductions that were announced late last year will also provide a significant boost to consumption in 2011.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Prolonged uncertainty about the global economic and financial environment is likely to dampen the rate of growth of business investment, albeit to a still solid pace."
0,xbos xfld 1 This divergence reflects the impact of the dramatic rise in energy prices on the total CPI.
0,xbos xfld 1 The procyclical effects of this additional firm and employment creation could provide a boost to potential output growth.
0,"xbos xfld 1 At the same time, production in other goods industries is also picking up, while the solid expansion in the service sector persists."
0,xbos xfld 1 This was accompanied by further strong growth in household credit.
0,"xbos xfld 1 As well, imports will be boosted by strong investment in machinery and equipment."
0,xbos xfld 1 Vacancy rates in the commercial real estate sector were also at very low levels in the first quarter of 2001.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Economic growth has been uneven in recent quarters, fluctuating around the rate of potential output growth."
0,"xbos xfld 1 The prices of fuel oil, gasoline, and natural gas have been directly affected, while indirect effects have raised the prices for other goods and services that are included in the core CPI, such as air travel."
0,"xbos xfld 1 The Canadian economy is now in a period of more modest growth, following the strong recovery experienced in late 2009 and early 2010."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Growth in residential investment, which is currently supported by very favourable mortgage-financing conditions, is forecast to slow over the projection horizon."
0,xbos xfld 1 Inflation is expected to remain within the target range and move toward 2 per cent over the projection horizon.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Partly as a result, Canada's current account balance has declined from a pre-recession surplus to a deficit of approximately 2 per cent of GDP, which is projected to persist over the forecast horizon."
0,"xbos xfld 1 A slightly higher profile for oil prices than previously assumed is also incorporated, as is the estimated impact of the increase in the Quebec Sales Tax."
0,"xbos xfld 1 In Japan, a surprisingly weak third quarter prompted the Bank of Japan to step up quantitative easing, and the government to postpone the planned sales tax hike and introduce further fiscal stimulus."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Although the effects of the fiscal stimulus introduced during the recession have begun to diminish and the measures to cool activity in the property market have started to take hold, growth in investment and consumption has remained robust."
0,xbos xfld 1 Exports also rebounded in the fourth quarter of 2003 as a result of the strengthening global economic recovery.
0,xbos xfld 1 The Canadian economy contracted by 1.6 per cent (at an annualized rate) in the second quarter of 2016.
0,"xbos xfld 1 In Canada, market expectations, based on short-term interest rates, currently suggest little change in the policy rate in the coming months."
0,"xbos xfld 1 This contributed to further moderation in the annual increase in nominal GDP, which rose by only 2.8 per cent in the year ending in the fourth quarter of 2006."
0,"xbos xfld 1 On the downside, global private demand around the world, including in the United States, may be insufficient to sustain the recovery."
0,"xbos xfld 1 However, since early April, the Canadian dollar has moved above this range as a result of several developments, including the rise in commodity prices and relatively stronger economic data in Canada than in the United States."
0,"xbos xfld 1 The combined effect of a weaker US outlook and a higher assumed level for the Canadian dollar implies, however, that net exports will exert a more significant drag on the economy in 2008 and 2009 than previously expected."
0,"xbos xfld 1 With declining short-term interest rates and a lower Canadian dollar, monetary conditions have eased substantially since the November Report."
0,xbos xfld 1 Other financial developments are consistent with signs of economic recovery.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Crude oil prices, which were US$58 per barrel at the time of the July Update, averaged US$63 per barrel in the 10 days ending on 14 October 2005."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Nonetheless, the continued strength in household credit growth is somewhat surprising, given the moderation of activity in the housing market and the reported decline in consumer confidence."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Moreover, whereas earlier in the year, only a few sectors, such as telecommunications and automotive manufacturing, had been affected, more industries are now feeling the effects of the tighter credit conditions."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Stock markets are at or near recent highs, credit spreads have narrowed, and issuance remains robust."
0,xbos xfld 1 Short-term interest rates embody expectations that policy rates in these two countries will remain at their current levels for the rest of 2006 but decline somewhat in 2007.
0,"xbos xfld 1 More generally, various aspects of the current climate, including robust employment gains and favourable financial conditions, suggest that stronger, more sustainable economic growth resumed in the fourth quarter of 2003."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Since the April Monetary Policy Report, three developments have led the Bank of Canada to make small modifications to its outlook for economic growth and inflation in Canada."
0,"xbos xfld 1 The downward trend in M1 growth since late 1997 partly reflects the declining influence of the special factors that contributed to high M1 growth in the past few years, particularly movements of funds from non-personal notice accounts (not included in M1) into current accounts (included in M1)."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Despite ongoing strength in the global economy, there was a broad-based decline in Canada's exports in the first half of 2006, which appears to be related to several factors."
0,xbos xfld 1 Several indicators suggest that the amount of excess demand in the Canadian economy increased in the second quarter of 2007 relative to that expected at the time of the April Report.
0,"xbos xfld 1 The US economy has been expanding at a solid pace, with recent data signalling more momentum than anticipated in the April Report."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Against this backdrop, financing conditions in Canada remain favourable."
0,"xbos xfld 1 The sharp correction in major Chinese stock indexes in recent weeks reflects, in part, these concerns and could have broader negative effects on confidence."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Nevertheless, as global financial conditions normalize, investors will continue to reassess the prospects for EMEs."
0,"xbos xfld 1 In this context, authorities have announced new fiscal and credit stimulus that should counter some of the expected drag."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Despite notable improvements in March, both employment and the unemployment rate are little changed, overall, from their levels six months ago."
0,"xbos xfld 1 If oil prices were to stay near their current high levels of just over US$30 per barrel, total CPI inflation could move up to between 4.0 and 4.5 per cent in the first quarter of 2003."
0,"xbos xfld 1 The ongoing slowdown, also reflected in weak industrial production data, is the result of continuing efforts by Chinese authorities to rein in an overheated property market, as well as reduced external demand, particularly from Europe."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Responses show that capacity pressures in the Prairie provinces have eased significantly, continuing a recent trend."
0,xbos xfld 1 The Fed has indicated that it will continue this MBS purchase program (or undertake additional asset purchases) until there is a substantial improvement in the outlook for the US labour market in a context of price stability.
0,xbos xfld 1 The recent price-level adjustments for automobiles and the effect of past changes in indirect taxes will keep measured inflation below target through 2008.
0,xbos xfld 1 Real GDP is projected to grow by 1.1 per cent in 2016 and about 2 per cent in 2017 and 2018.
0,"xbos xfld 1 This reflects the strong financial positions of Canadian firms, favourable credit conditions and the strong Canadian dollar, as well as the impetus to improve productivity amid heightened pressures to become more competitive."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Because the strength of export growth in the first two quarters mainly reflected a faster-than-expected rebound in oil exports after temporary pipeline shutdowns in late 2017, export growth in the third quarter is expected to slow."
0,"xbos xfld 1 The turbulence that characterized international markets last autumn has subsided, investor confidence is being restored, and the US economy has been remarkably robust."
0,"xbos xfld 1 While actual and anticipated reductions in government debt continue to put downward pressure on long-term government bond yields, the inversion of the yield curve for longer-term bonds is slightly less pronounced than it was at the time of the May Report."
0,"xbos xfld 1 However, both surveys noted some tightening for firms tied to commodity-related production."
0,xbos xfld 1 The outlook for both 2006 and 2007 is lower than that in the July Update.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Despite strong global economic expansion, non-energy commodity prices have eased."
0,"xbos xfld 1 On the basis of historical relationships, the recent rates of increase in M1 imply a growth rate of economic activity in the first half of 1999 of about 3 per cent."
0,xbos xfld 1 The Bank's base-case projection now sees slightly stronger growth in the second half of 2009 than was projected in the July Report.
0,"xbos xfld 1 On balance, however, it declined only slightly over the past six months."
0,xbos xfld 1 Early indicators point to continued strong investment growth in the first quarter of 2000.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Canadian exports are projected to pick up gradually but remain below their pre-recession peak until the first half of 2014, reflecting weak foreign demand and ongoing competitiveness challenges."
0,"xbos xfld 1 It is not yet clear, however, when a self-sustaining recovery based on private sector demand will take hold."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Factors supporting a strong expansion include current capacity constraints, expectations of ongoing growth in the global economy, indications that energy and metals prices will stay relatively high for some time, continued favourable financial conditions, strong profit levels overall and very solid balance sheets, and further reductions in the prices of imported machinery and equipment."
0,"xbos xfld 1 As a result, effective borrowing rates for households, while still low, have risen slightly since the October Report."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Wage increases have remained subdued, consistent with the observed softness in price inflation in the services sector."
0,"xbos xfld 1 In the Bank's view, the economy should reach a level close to the current estimate of full capacity during the course of 1999."
0,"xbos xfld 1 In the first quarter of 1998, further substantial employment gains (especially in paid, full-time jobs) helped keep consumer confidence relatively high."
0,"xbos xfld 1 The divergence in market-implied monetary policy paths and expected economic growth rates is, to some extent, contributing to the strength of the US dollar, which has appreciated since the July Report against a number of currencies, including the Canadian dollar."
0,"xbos xfld 1 In the fourth quarter, economic growth picked up to an annual rate of 3.8 per cent, about the same as anticipated in the last Report and in the January Update, although final domestic demand was slightly weaker than expected and external demand was slightly stronger."
0,"xbos xfld 1 According to available indicators, wages appear to have increased by about 3 per cent in the first half of 2000."
0,"xbos xfld 1 The foreign exchange value of the Canadian dollar is one relevant factor: although the Canadian dollar depreciated against the US dollar in recent years, which improved Canada's export competitiveness, competitors for US market share have also experienced currency depreciations, in some cases by more than that for the Canadian dollar."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Responses to the Bank's Business Outlook Survey in recent quarters have shown that the proportion of firms that would have difficulty responding to an unexpected increase in demand has stayed close to its historical average, while the proportion of firms reporting labour shortages in the Bank's summer Business Outlook Survey has remained somewhat below its historical average."
0,"xbos xfld 1 At the same time, certain categories of price movements have had a significant effect on aggregate consumer and producer price measures."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Energy prices have registered the sharpest drop, while prices for non-energy commodities have decreased more modestly, owing to tight near-term supply conditions for agricultural commodities."
0,xbos xfld 1 Rates of manufacturing capacity utilization for many industries in export categories that are more sensitive to the exchange rate have risen close to their historical highs.
0,xbos xfld 1 The Bank's monitoring of available information and its assessment of the modest adverse economic effects arising from the recent hurricane induced disruption of the US economy point to Canadian GDP growth of about 3 per cent in the third quarter of 2005.
0,"xbos xfld 1 As the second track gains strength and Canadian producers benefit from the depreciation of the Canadian dollar, it should re-emerge as the dominant one."
0,xbos xfld 1 Growth in 2019 is projected to approach estimated potential output growth.
0,"xbos xfld 1 This extends a recent trend toward slower growth in household spending, which, combined with the downward revisions to the debt-to-income ratio and upward revisions to the savings rate, points to increased household prudence."
0,xbos xfld 1 Strengthening employment and rising consumer and business confidence should stimulate domestic demand through the rest of the year.
0,"xbos xfld 1 The per barrel prices for Brent, West Texas Intermediate and Western Canada Select in US dollars have averaged $37, $36 and $22, respectively, since early December."
0,xbos xfld 1 The sharp decline in investment in the oil and gas sector in 2015 and 2016 is expected to restrain future production.
0,xbos xfld 1 Recent data point to some slowing of growth in the United States.
0,"xbos xfld 1 While the global recession has intensified since the January Update and become more synchronous, the broad profile of the Bank's outlook remains consistent with the projection at that time."
0,xbos xfld 1 The Bank believes that US economic activity will pick up to a rate of about 4 per cent in 2004.
0,"xbos xfld 1 As well, the differential between 30-year conventional and Real Return bonds is now just above 2 per cent."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Because the boost to Canadian exports from the anticipated continuing recovery in the US economy will be dampened by the earlier appreciation of the Canadian dollar, much of the growth in aggregate demand will have to come from domestic sources."
0,"xbos xfld 1 The principal risk is that, as the savings rates of households and governments begin to rise in the United States, domestic demand elsewhere in the world fails to pick up sufficiently to sustain global demand."
0,"xbos xfld 1 These price movements have generally been less pronounced than those observed in oil markets, however, suggesting that recent shifts in global demand are not the driving force behind the large movements in oil prices."
0,"xbos xfld 1 While the rate of increase in fuel oil and gasoline prices has eased over this period, tight supplies of natural gas have led to a substantial jump in overall energy prices."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Nevertheless, as in July, the Bank attempts to better balance the risks around the outlook by incorporating at least some of the adverse impact of the elevated global uncertainty into the base case."
0,"xbos xfld 1 The expected strong economic expansion, especially in various Asian economies, should continue to support the price of non-energy commodities over the remainder of 2004 and through 2005."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Although domestic demand in Canada has continued to grow at a robust pace, GDP growth in the second and third quarters of 2006 has been slower than expected, largely because of weaker net exports."
0,"xbos xfld 1 The Survey indicates that many firms are taking measures to improve productivity and reduce costs, not only in response to the dollar's appreciation, but also because of increased competition from Asian suppliers."
0,xbos xfld 1 Aggregate growth is reflecting economic activity that is progressing along two different tracks.
0,"xbos xfld 1 The pace of household credit growth has moderated in recent months, however, following a long period of comparatively rapid growth that has pushed household indebtedness to record levels relative to disposable income."
0,"xbos xfld 1 In the Bank's latest Business Outlook Survey, the percentage of companies reporting that they would have difficulty in meeting an unanticipated increase in demand rose to the highest level since mid-2000."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Four of the most important risks are described below: three of them emanate from the external environment, while one is domestic."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Final domestic demand has remained the key driver of economic growth in Canada, bolstered by firm commodity prices."
0,"xbos xfld 1 In its October Quarterly Survey of Canadian Business Attitudes, the Conference Board of Canada reported that 28 per cent of respondents expected inflation to be 3 per cent over the near term, compared with only 17 per cent in the first-quarter survey, while nearly 72 per cent of respondents still expected inflation to be 2 per cent or less."
0,"xbos xfld 1 In newly industrialized and emerging-market economies, particularly China, GDP growth in recent quarters was stronger than expected."

0,xbos xfld 1 And financial markets now seem to be better able to assess and differentiate among credit risks.
0,"xbos xfld 1 In the United States, the Treasury yield curve has inverted since November, and now has a negative slope."
0,xbos xfld 1 A number of risks surround this base-case scenario.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Gross domestic product growth is projected to ease to around 2 per cent in 2020, close to US potential growth, as support from fiscal and monetary policy diminishes."
0,"xbos xfld 1 In China, real GDP growth is expected to remain strong, but should moderate through 2012-13 in response to monetary tightening and a further real appreciation of the Chinese currency."
0,xbos xfld 1 Prices and markups for clothing and other semi-durable goods have also been higher than expected.
0,"xbos xfld 1 This rise is also consistent with market expectations for inflation, which appear to have stabilized and, in some cases, started to drift up after being on a gradual downward trend through the first half of 2017."
0,"xbos xfld 1 In contrast, there is likely to be prolonged downward pressure on profitability in many industries highly exposed to international competition (other than those producing energy and other commodities), primarily because of the Canadian dollar's appreciation and growing competition from such economies as China and India."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Another source of uncertainty for the US economy is that country's large current account deficit, which now stands at about 4 per cent of GDP."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Based on a review of all the indicators of capacity pressures, it is the judgment of the Governing Council that the Canadian economy was operating at, or just above, its production capacity in early 2006."
0,"xbos xfld 1 These include a rise in air fares due to higher fuel costs, an increase in auto insurance costs in Ontario following a government-mandated change in the insurance system, and some reconstitution of retail profit margins."
0,xbos xfld 1 The BCPI is anticipated to remain relatively stable.
0,"xbos xfld 1 The Bank estimates that US growth in the fourth quarter rose to 4.6 per cent, driven principally by an important contribution from inventories, continued robust growth in exports, and steady increases in residential construction."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Export growth in 2011 is projected to be somewhat weaker than assumed in January, owing to more subdued prospects for US economic activity and the higher value assumed for the Canadian dollar."
0,"xbos xfld 1 In particular, the prices of fuel oil and gasoline began to decline, as anticipated in the last issue of the Report."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Without this, large imbalances may reemerge, with the attendant risk of disorderly adjustment."
0,"xbos xfld 1 This sequence is progressing, albeit unevenly."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Growth in all three major export groupings - energy-related commodities, non-energy commodities and non-commodities - is expected to pick up, although commodity exports will contribute the most to growth in GDP."
0,xbos xfld 1 The global economy has continued to expand robustly.
0,xbos xfld 1 The Bank expects further economic slack to be taken up through 1998.
0,xbos xfld 1 Prices for many commodities have increased since the July Report.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Narrow credit spreads reflect healthy corporate balance sheets, continued investor demand for higher-yielding securities, and a high level of liquidity in global financial markets."
0,xbos xfld 1 Wage growth is somewhat below what would be expected were the economy operating with no excess labour.
0,"xbos xfld 1 The outlook for Japan remains largely unchanged, with heavy reliance on external demand for growth."
0,xbos xfld 1 Canada should benefit from the growing strength of its major trading partner.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Moreover, the results of the Bank's latest Business Outlook Survey suggest that investment and hiring intentions remain strong across all regions and most sectors, and that, overall, companies remain positive about the outlook."
0,xbos xfld 1 Financing conditions for households and businesses in Canada remain highly stimulative.
0,"xbos xfld 1 In particular, many firms in industries with a high exposure to international trade have focused on improving productivity and reducing costs."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Monthly indicators support a further pickup in activity in the third quarter, led by particularly robust housing activity and consumer spending."
0,"xbos xfld 1 This generalized weakness likely reflects common international factors, such as reductions in global food and energy prices, as well as the impact from still sizable negative output gaps and high unemployment."
0,xbos xfld 1 The year-over-year rise in labour compensation in the business sector eased between the second quarter of 2000 and the second quarter of 2001.
0,"xbos xfld 1 In Canada, solid growth in final domestic demand is expected to continue to contribute importantly to economic activity over the remainder of this year and through 2006."
0,xbos xfld 1 Data since the July Report also point to more momentum in economic activity than previously anticipated.
0,"xbos xfld 1 The sensitivity of consumption and housing to interest rates is estimated to be larger than in past cycles, given the elevated ratio of household debt to disposable income."
0,"xbos xfld 1 In addition to the factors lowering CPI inflation, the broad measures, which include the prices of exported products, have been directly affected by the considerable decline in the prices of primary commodity exports."
0,xbos xfld 1 Most measures of core inflation remain close to 2 per cent but would be lower without the effect of exchange rate pass-through.
0,xbos xfld 1 Financing conditions for businesses have improved as well.
0,xbos xfld 1 A temporary jump in the core rate in December 2003 was the result of Ontario electricity rebates at the end of 2002.
0,"xbos xfld 1 The estimated drag in 2013 is larger, however, reflecting the impact of spending cuts that are assumed to take place during 2013."
0,"xbos xfld 1 However, the profile of activity for the third and fourth quarters will likely mean that by year-end the output gap will not be much different than it was in mid-1995."
0,xbos xfld 1 Ongoing geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and disruptions at Libyan ports added to the upward pressure on oil prices.
0,"xbos xfld 1 In Canada, this has resulted in a considerable slowing in the growth of total business credit since the last Report."
0,xbos xfld 1 The Bank's overall outlook for the Canadian economy is little changed from October.
0,"xbos xfld 1 This resilience reflects the slower-than-anticipated deceleration in wages, since labour costs represent a large portion of total production costs in core services."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Some peripheral economies continue to face significant challenges, however."
0,"xbos xfld 1 In the long-distance telephone market, deregulation has increased competition and reduced rates."
0,"xbos xfld 1 If additional spending were financed by more borrowing, then vulnerabilities associated with household indebtedness could be exacerbated."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Economy-wide, the price level has remained virtually unchanged."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Over 2012-13, growth is expected to recover, owing to reconstruction activity, as well as a gradual strengthening in private demand, supported by improving labour market conditions."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Nonetheless, weaker growth in the second half of 2010 implies somewhat greater excess capacity in the near term."
0,"xbos xfld 1 In contrast, there is the potential for downward pressure on base metals prices as several new mining projects come on line globally."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Overall, net exports are expected to remain a source of weakness."
0,"xbos xfld 1 The level of economic activity and the corresponding degree of slack are influenced by many factors, including the stance of monetary policy."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Transportation capacity is expected to remain a source of restraint on energy exports, while global trade policy uncertainty and elevated competition from other countries—especially in the US market—also remain sources of drag."
0,xbos xfld 1 Included in this concerted action was a 50-basis-point reduction in policy rates announced by both the European Central Bank and the Bank of England.
0,"xbos xfld 1 For example, the proportion of involuntary part-time workers and the average duration of unemployment are still elevated, and wage increases remain subdued."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Business credit has started to grow again, led by an increase in market-based sources of credit."
0,"xbos xfld 1 The Bank judges that, to date, the adjustments mean that near-term potential output growth is likely in the lower part of the range of estimates provided in the April 2015 Report."
0,xbos xfld 1 An important factor behind the weakness of aggregate activity in the second quarter of 2003 was the unexpectedly sharp drop in inventory investment.
0,xbos xfld 1 Measures of inflation rose through the first half of 1995 as a result of both exchange rate and commodity price effects on consumer prices.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Given the enormous shift from deposits to mutual funds in the 1990s, it is probably most informative for this purpose to look at the very broad aggregate M2++, which includes all mutual funds sold in Canada."
0,"xbos xfld 1 This was reinforced by the strong competitive position of Canadian industry, which has favoured both export growth and increased substitution of domestic products for imports."
0,"xbos xfld 1 On balance, net exports have been a drag on the economy."
0,"xbos xfld 1 In this context, pressures in the European banking sector have escalated, contributing to a sharp slowdown in economic growth in the euro area."
0,"xbos xfld 1 As reported in the Bank's winter Business Outlook Survey, 92 per cent of firms expect average inflation over the next two years to remain within the 1 to 3 per cent inflation-control range."
0,xbos xfld 1 A steep yield curve has usually been followed by strong GDP growth over the next four quarters.
0,"xbos xfld 1 On the other hand, employment has fallen in the other manufacturing industries highly exposed to international trade, reflecting to some extent the substitution of capital for labour in order to reduce costs."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Upward revisions to forecasts for US crop production contributed to a decline in grain prices, and the prices of forest products have also eased as a result of somewhat weaker demand."
0,xbos xfld 1 Core inflation had been held down temporarily early this year as a result of increased price discounting by motor vehicle manufacturers and dealers and by a special provincial government credit program for electricity customers in British Columbia.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Economic activity is expected to be somewhat weaker thereafter, reflecting fiscal austerity measures and financial pressures arising from continuing concerns about the sustainability of peripheral-country debt."
0,"xbos xfld 1 As a result, the level of Canada's exports is not forecast to regain its pre-recession peak until the second half of 2014."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Underlying pressures affecting prices remain subdued, reflecting the considerable slack in the Canadian economy."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Prices for base metals have weakened, and there has been a substantial reduction in newsprint prices."

0,"xbos xfld 1 Components of US demand that are important for Canadian exports, such as business investment in equipment, housing and consumption, are expected to grow at a solid pace."
0,"xbos xfld 1 The 1997 forecast was marginally lower than that of six months earlier, while the 1998 forecast was unchanged."
0,xbos xfld 1 Additional uncertainty about the path of energy prices over the near term has resulted from recent political developments in the Middle East.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Metals prices are expected to remain at current levels until the end of 2013, before rising in 2014 owing to stronger global economic growth."
0,xbos xfld 1 A more comprehensive labour market indicator estimated by the Bank also suggests that the unemployment rate may have overstated the extent of improvements in labour markets.
0,"xbos xfld 1 The lower level of short-term market interest rates reflects not only the lower policy rate, but also market expectations that short-term rates will stay low and stable for some time."
0,"xbos xfld 1 The expanding global economy and the resulting high level of commodity prices, the contribution of the higher Canadian dollar to reduced costs of imported machinery and equipment, and favourable financial conditions should all lead to robust growth in capital expenditures by businesses."
0,"xbos xfld 1 After moderating this quarter, total CPI inflation is expected, along with core inflation, to be around 2 per cent over the balance of the projection horizon as the economy reaches its production potential, the growth of labour compensation remains moderate and inflation expectations stay well anchored."
0,xbos xfld 1 There is a risk that the property market in China could cool faster than anticipated as credit slows.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Many producers of low-cost conventional oil responded to the initial decline in oil prices by ramping up production, partly to compensate for the loss of oil revenues."
0,"xbos xfld 1 The price of existing housing, based on the Royal LePage index, has picked up somewhat this year with the record pace of sales."
0,"xbos xfld 1 The authorities are expected to encourage a rotation of demand away from investment and toward consumption, while reining in credit growth."
0,xbos xfld 1 This section describes the Bank's outlook for the global and Canadian economies through to the end of 2009.

0,"xbos xfld 1 Ongoing strong rates of construction, particularly of multiple-unit dwellings in some regions, continue to point to overbuilding."
0,"xbos xfld 1 The global economy experienced a widespread slowdown in activity, investment and trade in the first quarter, reflecting the coincident occurrence of a diverse set of country-specific factors."
0,"xbos xfld 1 While growth in household spending has been moderate in recent quarters, it has been disproportionately supported by housing investment, which is around historical highs and showing signs of overbuilding."
0,"xbos xfld 1 As a result, US GDP growth is expected to slow to 2.1 per cent in 2007, before picking up to 2.8 per cent in 2008 and to 3.1 per cent in 2009."
0,"xbos xfld 1 In the United States, economic growth is expected to remain below potential in 2009 and 2010, causing unemployment to continue to rise."
0,xbos xfld 1 Export-oriented countries in Asia and Europe have experienced sharp declines in industrial production.
0,xbos xfld 1 This stimulus is needed to offset the considerable headwinds faced by both countries.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Improved exports are expected to lead to more business investment, net firm creation and hiring."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Higher interest rates were deemed necessary to keep the future trend of inflation near the middle of the Bank's 1 to 3 per cent target range, thus contributing to sustained economic growth."
0,"xbos xfld 1 More generally, the resulting negative surprise in core inflation is also consistent with the continued presence of some slack in product markets during the first half of the year."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Meanwhile, although the population of firms in the mining, oil and gas industries has declined by 7.1 per cent since oil prices peaked in the middle of 2014, the number of firms in the rest of the economy has increased by 1.5 per cent."
0,xbos xfld 1 This profile is based on several factors.
0,"xbos xfld 1 First, given important supply-chain linkages between Canada and the United States (e.g., in the oil and gas sector), weaker-than-expected US industrial production likely weighed on Canadian exports."
0,"xbos xfld 1 The growth rate of the broad money aggregate, M2++, has risen somewhat since the last Report from relatively low levels."
0,xbos xfld 1 It is important to note that the Bank has changed its working assumption for the profile of energy prices in its base-case projection.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Capital flows back into emerging-market economies are tentative, awaiting full implementation of announced policies in a number of key countries."
0,"xbos xfld 1 These disruptions could translate into a decline in confidence and economic activity (especially in sectors sensitive to interest rates), reduced wealth, a rise in debt-service burdens, and weaker global and Canadian growth."
0,"xbos xfld 1 In most advanced economies, policy rates have stayed at or near historic lows as a result of excess supply conditions and subdued underlying inflation pressures."
0,"xbos xfld 1 In the third quarter of this year, the effect of excess supply subtracts 0.2 percentage points from inflation."
0,xbos xfld 1 The trade-weighted index for the Canadian dollar has fallen by 14 per cent since the July Update.
0,xbos xfld 1 These movements will mainly reflect the effects of special factors a year ago.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Together with a moderation in the growth of household spending, this is expected to gradually return Canada's economy to a more balanced growth path."
0,"xbos xfld 1 These increases were supported by strong overall profitability, ongoing reductions in the prices of imported machinery and equipment, and favourable financing conditions."
0,xbos xfld 1 The recently announced federal measures to promote stability in the housing market are expected to lead to weaker resale activity in the near term and a modest change in the composition of residential construction toward smaller units.
0,xbos xfld 1 The central tendency is about 1 3/4 per cent.
0,"xbos xfld 1 However, growth is expected to be reasonably well sustained in North America, continental Europe, and the United Kingdom, given the underlying momentum in domestic demand in these economies."
0,"xbos xfld 1 The shutdown will dampen economic growth in the fourth quarter, through the direct effect of furloughed government workers, and, more broadly, through negative effects on confidence."
0,"xbos xfld 1 The US economy is judged to be in recession through the first quarter of 2009, and to remain weaker than previously projected over the balance of the year, as tighter credit conditions and waning confidence lower household consumption and reduce residential and business investment."
0,xbos xfld 1 The outlook for the 12-month rate of increase in the total CPI will continue to be crucially affected by developments in the markets for crude oil.
0,"xbos xfld 1 This has led to falling investor confidence and, in turn, to rising risk premiums on corporate bonds and weakness in equity markets in Canada."
0,xbos xfld 1 These developments raise several key areas of uncertainty for the conduct of Canadian monetary policy in the period ahead.
0,xbos xfld 1 The expanding world economy is expected to provide support to Canadian exports over the projection horizon.
0,"xbos xfld 1 In particular, exports and business fixed investment have been weaker, reflecting both foreign and domestic developments."
0,"xbos xfld 1 The increase in yields has been driven by stronger growth and market expectations of less accommodative monetary policy in advanced economies, including the reduction of the Federal Reserve balance sheet that is anticipated to begin later this year."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Business investment in capital goods increased very strongly in the first half of 1999, as business confidence recovered in light of favourable international developments."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Meanwhile, in Japan, subdued inflation also remains a risk, despite an important pickup in both total and core inflation over the past year following the introduction of aggressive monetary easing."
0,xbos xfld 1 The recent sizeable depreciation of the Canadian dollar will also provide an important offset to the effects of weaker global demand and lower commodity prices.
0,"xbos xfld 1 The 12-month rate of increase in the core CPI was 1.3 per cent in September, compared with 1.5 per cent in March."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Overall, global economic growth is expected to rise from about 3 per cent this year to 3 1/2 per cent in 2017-18."
0,"xbos xfld 1 As these policy interventions are unwound, the dampening effects of monetary policy on volatility are diminishing."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Relative to the January Report, the ongoing recession is expected to be somewhat shallower, owing to smaller-than-anticipated negative effects from both bank deleveraging and weak confidence levels."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Global economic conditions have brightened since the April Report, supported by monetary and fiscal stimulus."
0,"xbos xfld 1 In contrast, the Bank's conventional measure indicates that the output gap was still significant."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Similarly, expectations of low prices and competitiveness issues will weigh on activity in the mining and related sectors (particularly for intermediate metal products)."
0,"xbos xfld 1 At the same time, because of further substantial increases in energy prices, the rate of increase in the total CPI has continued to be well above that of core inflation."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Since estimates of full capacity are inexact, the Bank will closely monitor all the indicators that could provide information on the capacity of the economy."
0,xbos xfld 1 Growth is expected to be particularly weak in the first half of the year before recovering later in 2008 and 2009.
0,"xbos xfld 1 When all of this is taken into account, the current outlook for inflation is consistent with the Bank's inflation-control targets."
0,"xbos xfld 1 The Bank's base-case projection calls for economic growth, on an average annual basis, to be 2.7 per cent in 2005 and to rise to 3.3 per cent in 2006."
0,xbos xfld 1 The influence of strong domestic demand was particularly evident in the prices of core services.
0,"xbos xfld 1 In the first quarter of 2010, the level of real GDP moved back up, close to its pre-recession peak, owing to ongoing fiscal stimulus, the strength in consumer spending, and robust residential investment."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Equity prices in North America, Europe and a number of emerging markets in addition to China have also declined."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Both employment levels and average hours worked appear to have bottomed out in the summer, and the unemployment rate has been hovering around 8.5 per cent."
0,xbos xfld 1 The effect is expected to be larger on total CPI inflation than on the core rate and is expected to be in the nature of a one-off price-level movement.
0,"xbos xfld 1 The core rate is projected to rise to 2 per cent by mid-2006 and to remain there through 2007, owing to these same factors."
0,"xbos xfld 1 At the same time, with a further modest gain in the growth of labour productivity, the projected year-to-year increase in unit labour costs should be close to 2 per cent."
0,"xbos xfld 1 In view of the volatility in the core rate observed in 2004 to date, the level of uncertainty surrounding the near-term monitoring of core inflation is somewhat higher than normal."
0,"xbos xfld 1 In China and other emerging-market countries, the deceleration in economic growth has been greater than previously anticipated."
0,xbos xfld 1 Reconstruction activities are expected to boost economic growth in Japan over 2012-13.
0,xbos xfld 1 Further improvement in Canada's terms of trade led to an even sharper rise in real gross domestic income.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Together with exports, business investment is nonetheless expected to continue to provide significant support to the US economic expansion over the projection horizon."
0,xbos xfld 1 Core inflation is expected to rise further in the coming quarters as the economy experiences more excess demand and the transitory effect of the past decline in telecommunication prices passes.
0,"xbos xfld 1 With these growth profiles for GDP and potential output, the economy would remain in excess demand through to early 2009."
0,xbos xfld 1 They have also adopted additional measures to provide liquidity support to the financial system.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Core CPI inflation averaged 1.5 per cent in the first eight months of 2004, below the Bank's 2 per cent inflation-control target."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Following a substantial increase in 2005, consumer spending is also expected to rise solidly over the projection period."
0,"xbos xfld 1 As well, there was a further shift in the composition of demand towards consumption and away from exports."
0,xbos xfld 1 The rapid pace of hiring and swift decline in the unemployment rate in the past few months indicate that labour market slack is being absorbed more quickly than expected.
0,"xbos xfld 1 As a result of this combination of rising short-term rates and comparatively stable long-term yields, yield curves globally are somewhat flatter."
0,xbos xfld 1 Growth has been supported by relatively solid exports and investment.
0,xbos xfld 1 Sentiment has been improving with the higher oil prices and indications of progress toward addressing shortages of pipeline capacity.
0,"xbos xfld 1 The rise in average prices received by Canadian commodity producers continued to be reflected in the aggregate industrial product price index , as well as in a further marked rise in aggregate export prices."
0,"xbos xfld 1 These included increased automobile rebates, exceptionally heavy discounts on clothing, promotions of new cablevision channels, and an earlier-than-expected seasonal decline in hotel rates."
0,xbos xfld 1 Investment in housing is projected to weaken markedly through the remainder of 2010 and well into 2011.
0,"xbos xfld 1 This implies that the economy would be in slight excess demand in 2006, before returning to potential output by the end of the projection period."
0,"xbos xfld 1 After sharp declines earlier in 2018, national resales have started recovering."
0,xbos xfld 1 It is these relative movements in individual prices that signal the need to move resources into or out of production.
0,"xbos xfld 1 While unemployment rates remain high in most major advanced countries, there are signs that the pace of deterioration in labour market conditions has started to ease."
0,xbos xfld 1 Export volumes are expected to recover over the projection period in response to the improvement in external demand - partly reflecting a pickup in motor vehicle production in North America (from the very low levels in 2009) and a rebound in US housing activity - as well as higher commodity prices.
0,"xbos xfld 1 In this context, the Canadian dollar is assumed to remain close to its recent average of 76 cents US, compared with 78 cents US in April."
0,xbos xfld 1 The echo effect of the temporary discounting in the wake of 11 September 2001 is no longer influencing core CPI inflation.
0,xbos xfld 1 Consumer energy price inflation will rise temporarily in 2017 to reflect higher prices for energy commodities and the impact of the new regulations related to the cap-and-trade plan in Ontario and the carbon levy in Alberta.
0,"xbos xfld 1 As reported in the Bank's autumn Business Outlook Survey, almost all firms surveyed continue to expect average inflation over the next two years to remain within the 1 to 3 per cent inflation-control range."
0,"xbos xfld 1 The recent decline in the prices of crude oil and natural gas will likely lead to a further reduction in Canada's terms of trade over the remainder of 2006 and, therefore, to slower growth in nominal GDP."
0,"xbos xfld 1 US inflation, as measured by the CPI excluding food and energy prices, has been stable at around 2.2 per cent since last September."
0,"xbos xfld 1 The employment-to-population ratio reached a record high in May 2006, and the unemployment rate fell to its lowest level since the mid-1970s."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Despite these initiatives, little economic improvement is expected this year, owing to the adverse impact of the Asian crisis, the fragility of the financial sector, and the low level of consumer and business confidence."
0,xbos xfld 1 The effects of these factors are expected to dissipate by early 2019.
0,xbos xfld 1 The reorientation of the Canadian economy toward the non-resource sector is being facilitated by the past depreciation of the Canadian dollar and accommodative financial conditions.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Total CPI inflation, excluding the impact of the recent GST reduction, is projected to average close to 2 per cent throughout 2008 and 2009."
0,"xbos xfld 1 The Chinese economy grew by close to 7 per cent in 2017, stronger than anticipated in the January Report, with some extra momentum spilling into 2018."
0,"xbos xfld 1 In the Bank's summer Business Outlook Survey, the percentage of companies reporting difficulties in meeting an unanticipated increase in demand remained above average."
0,"xbos xfld 1 The Bank continues to anticipate that consumption and business fixed investment will be the primary drivers of real GDP growth over the projection horizon, supported by accommodative domestic financial conditions."
0,xbos xfld 1 Financial investors may also reinforce momentum in commodity prices at the margin.
0,"xbos xfld 1 The foreign activity measure is expected to grow steadily over the projection horizon and to outpace the growth in trade-weighted foreign GDP as well as US GDP, reflecting sustained momentum in US business investment spending and a gradual recovery in the US housing market from depressed levels."
0,"xbos xfld 1 In advanced economies, financial conditions are buoyant."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Concerns about corporate governance and an unsettled geopolitical situation also increase uncertainty, which could cause households and corporations to postpone spending until a clearer picture emerges."
0,"xbos xfld 1 As well, business investment is expected to have begun its cyclical recovery, with recent indicators suggesting a strong rebound in the oil and gas sector and related manufacturing activities."
0,xbos xfld 1 The year-to-year rise in hourly labour compensation from Statistics Canada's Productivity Accounts - a more volatile indicator - also increased even more markedly to 5.7 per cent in the second quarter of 2007.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Despite subdued economic conditions, headline inflation in the euro area, at 2.4 per cent in June, has remained relatively elevated, partly reflecting increases in indirect taxes and administered prices."
0,"xbos xfld 1 The estimated pass-through is higher than was estimated in January, as the effects of the additional depreciation of the Canadian dollar since then are starting to materialize."
0,"xbos xfld 1 A pickup in household demand and ongoing improvements in confidence, combined with healthy firm balance sheets, should further stimulate business investment."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Given the magnitude and pace of the commodity price decline and the complexity and protracted nature of the adjustment process - with important structural and cyclical implications - there is particular uncertainty about the recovery in aggregate demand and economic activity, the level and evolution of potential output, and thus the timing of the economy's return to full potential."
0,"xbos xfld 1 However, with the US economy slowing more quickly than expected, the base-case projection for Canadian economic growth has been revised down slightly from that in the July Monetary Policy Report Update."
0,"xbos xfld 1 While the recovery is still tentative in Japan, business confidence and corporate profits, supported by strong export demand, have improved recently."
0,"xbos xfld 1 The growth rate of household credit has remained close to 5 per cent since the end of 2014, slightly stronger than the growth of disposable income."
0,"xbos xfld 1 This unwinding involves increased domestic demand in Asia, Europe, and oil-exporting countries in 2007; an increase in private and public savings in the United States; and a further real effective depreciation of the US dollar, which shifts demand towards US exports and reduces the US demand for foreign imports."
0,xbos xfld 1 This implies that the price for crude oil will be just below US$65 per barrel through 2006 and 2007.
0,"xbos xfld 1 And, while prospects for sustained US economic growth are clouded by the accumulation of fiscal and external imbalances, US output growth is projected to remain above that of potential in 2005."
0,"xbos xfld 1 First-quarter growth slowed primarily because of transitory factors, including drag from inventories and a weather-related decline in the consumption of utilities."
0,xbos xfld 1 The recovery is expected to be more gradual than usual.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Together, these developments suggest a broadening of the recovery across sectors."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Since growth is expected to be close to zero or slightly negative in the second half of 2001, annual average growth for 2001 would be about 1.5 per cent."
0,xbos xfld 1 The recovery in Canada's exports in the first half of the year was supported by strong economic growth in the United States.
0,"xbos xfld 1 As well, further large declines in residential investment in the United States resulted in reductions in Canadian exports of lumber and, to a lesser extent, other building materials."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Although narrow money is not expected to continue growing at its recent rapid pace, the current surge in money growth raises the possibility that core inflation might move into the upper half of the Bank's target range next year."
0,xbos xfld 1 The projection is consistent with medium- and long-term inflation expectations remaining well anchored.
0,xbos xfld 1 Reform-oriented governments are expected to implement structural changes that will remove impediments and encourage growth.
0,"xbos xfld 1 This could quite likely happen this year, given that the survey was begun in October when global financial markets were still very turbulent."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Consequently, the US economy appears to have solid underlying momentum in the second half of the year, and some pickup in growth can be expected as inventory adjustment is completed."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Growth in the third quarter of 1999 is expected to be even more robust than in the first half, as indicated by strong quarterly automobile sales as well as by healthy retail sales and production in July and Household expenditures rose much more strongly in the first six months of 1999 than in the second half of 1998."
0,"xbos xfld 1 After experiencing a considerable buildup of stocks early this year, retailers and wholesalers slashed their rates of inventory accumulation in the second quarter."
0,"xbos xfld 1 While economic expansion in the major European countries was modest during early 1996, the Japanese economy, on balance, experienced more robust growth."
0,"xbos xfld 1 This section outlines the Bank's outlook for the global economy through to the end of 2008, followed by the associated projection for the Canadian economy."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Recent data indicate a softening for the fourth quarter that is not expected to persist, given strong underlying fundamentals."
0,xbos xfld 1 The percentage of firms reporting labour shortages in the Bank's autumn Business Outlook Survey was somewhat below average.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Furthermore, the trajectory of potential output could be higher than anticipated, posing a downside risk to inflation."
0,xbos xfld 1 The gradual recovery is underpinned by the same factors highlighted in our previous projections.
0,"xbos xfld 1 However, when the first three quarters of 1998 are taken as a whole, these factors had little effect on growth."
0,xbos xfld 1 The pace of this movement will depend on the behaviour of oil prices.
0,"xbos xfld 1 In particular, inflation will likely ease in January 2018, reflecting the transitory effects of elevated gasoline prices a year earlier."
0,"xbos xfld 1 On a year-over-year basis, this real income measure is up nearly 4 per cent as a result of the significant rise in the prices of many commodities that Canada produces."
0,xbos xfld 1 The Bank continues to closely monitor a wide range of indicators of pressures on capacity and inflation.
0,"xbos xfld 1 In 2017, real GDP is expected to grow by 2.0 per cent."
0,"xbos xfld 1 While these increases have been consistent with expectations at the time of the April Report, price developments for many services have been slightly firmer than expected, although wage growth has remained modest."
0,"xbos xfld 1 In taking these actions, the Bank proceeded cautiously because of the potential implications for the dollar of the narrowing Canada-US short-term interest rate spreads at a time of impending political uncertainty."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Given the degree of uncertainty that is likely to persist over this period, monetary conditions may continue to fluctuate over a relatively wide range."
0,"xbos xfld 1 While the slowdown in real GDP growth undoubtedly played a role in this weak performance, recent declines in productivity have been most evident in sectors experiencing pronounced labour shortages, such as mining, oil and gas extraction, and construction, which had to draw on less-skilled workers."
0,xbos xfld 1 The projected stability of the non-energy commodity price index masks divergent pressures on component prices.
0,xbos xfld 1 The combination of tighter credit conditions and depressed demand have halted growth in household credit in the euro area and produced outright contractions in the United States.
0,xbos xfld 1 The slowdown in the Canadian economy is not yet evident in most labour market and wage indicators.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Compared with the April Report, growth has been marked down in 2011, owing mostly to a weaker near-term outlook for the United States and Japan, but it is broadly similar thereafter."
0,"xbos xfld 1 While near-term inflation expectations have risen, the average private sector forecast for total CPI inflation in 2004 has remained close to 2 per cent."
0,xbos xfld 1 The associated need for the global banking sector to continue to reduce leverage will restrain growth for some time.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Household spending is expected to grow moderately over the projection horizon, but a number of circumstances could lead to less robust spending than anticipated."
0,"xbos xfld 1 However, the future path for potential output could deviate from that projected in the base-case scenario."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Responses to the Bank's autumn Business Outlook Survey show that the balance of opinion on investment intentions has remained relatively high, but this is not expected to immediately translate into a large increase in investment growth."
0,"xbos xfld 1 As a result, the year-over-year rise in unit labour costs in the business sector was held to 1.0 per cent."
0,xbos xfld 1 This could result in a low level for the personal savings rate for a number of quarters.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Core inflation measures also started to drift upward in recent months, consistent with declining slack in the past and the diminishing drag from weak food inflation."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Consideration of both external and domestic factors suggests that economic activity should show renewed growth towards year-end, with a modest pickup in the third quarter followed by a more robust fourth quarter."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Over the past year, a significant amount of excess capacity in the economy has been absorbed, as indicated by a narrowing in the Bank's two measures of economic slack."
0,"xbos xfld 1 However, in 2018-19, consumption growth is anticipated to moderate and the savings rate to increase in response to slower growth of household disposable income and higher interest rates."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Exports of automotive products also fell sharply in June and July, mainly because of temporary shutdowns at General Motors, following labour disruptions at two US parts plants."
0,xbos xfld 1 Historical data for real GDP are frequently revised.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Moreover, the significant inventory correction in the fourth quarter and the recent resumption of growth in export volumes as a result of renewed economic expansion in the United States point to a recovery that is well underway."
0,xbos xfld 1 Economic growth in Canada is projected to average about 2 1/2 per cent in 2014 and 2015.
0,"xbos xfld 1 With the economy expected to be operating at production capacity and inflation expectations well anchored, total CPI inflation should decrease to the 2 per cent target in the second half of 2006."
0,"xbos xfld 1 The economic outlook for the major industrial countries is, on balance, encouraging and shows less divergence among countries than at the time of the last Report."
0,xbos xfld 1 Economic growth is expected to remain broad-based across sectors.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Exports decreased for a third consecutive quarter as a result of declining US spending on housing and automobiles, and the effects of the past appreciation of the Canadian dollar."
0,"xbos xfld 1 In the base-case projection, global economic growth slows in the second half of 2008 and in 2009, owing to weakness in the US economy, ongoing financial market turbulence, sharply higher commodity prices, and more restrictive monetary policy in a number of overseas economies."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Competition in the retail sector has remained particularly intense, although the considerable number of store closures in the first half of 1998 has reduced excess retail capacity."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Starting in the second half of 2016, real GDP is expected to increase at a rate that exceeds potential growth, driven by solid US domestic demand growth and federal infrastructure spending and other fiscal measures."
0,"xbos xfld 1 On the downside, the adjustment in the Canadian economy to the rapid appreciation of the Canadian dollar may dampen demand for Canadian goods and services and reduce inflationary pressures more than projected."
0,xbos xfld 1 The main upside risks to inflation are that domestic and international developments will generate more demand for Canadian goods and services than is currently anticipated.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Growth in consumer spending was very weak, restrained in part by the adjustment to higher prices for food and energy, while residential investment rebounded strongly, reflecting some pulling forward of activity in advance of changes in mortgage insurance regulations."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Based on the past dispersion of private sector forecasts, US economic growth in 2015 is anticipated to be within ±0.5 percentage points of the Bank's projection, with a somewhat wider range in 2016."
0,"xbos xfld 1 The underlying rate of increase in wages, based on such measures as the average hourly earnings of permanent workers, appears to have remained in a range between 2.25 and 3.25 per cent since the middle of 2004."
0,xbos xfld 1 A broadening of US tariffs could pose a significant risk to Canadian economic activity.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Mortgage rates are at record lows, both for fixed - and variable-rate mortgages, and growth in mortgage credit has picked up."
0,"xbos xfld 1 CPI inflation is expected to increase to around 2 per cent CPI inflation is anticipated to average 1.4 per cent in the fourth quarter and to move up to around 2 per cent in the second half of 2018, staying close to the target thereafter."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Consumption growth has been supported in recent months by declines in commodity prices from the peaks observed a year ago, as well as by an improvement in consumer confidence and the increased availability of motor vehicles at US dealerships following the restoration of Japanese supply chains."
0,"xbos xfld 1 In this regard, growth in China's real GDP has remained very strong, and the first-quarter rebound in Japan's real GDP was larger than expected."
0,xbos xfld 1 The Bank expects that GDP will grow somewhat faster than potential output over the projection horizon.
0,xbos xfld 1 These conditions should lead to a restoration of business confidence and to the start of a recovery in business investment.
0,xbos xfld 1 Sector-specific factors continue to provide temporary boosts to measured inflation.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Examples of large US dollar price rises during 1994 include pulp (69 per cent), newsprint (19 per cent), and base metals like nickel (60 per cent), copper (67 per cent) and aluminum (70 per cent)."
0,"xbos xfld 1 However, it is possible that the momentum in domestic demand could be greater than currently expected, owing to buoyant household confidence and easy financing conditions."
0,xbos xfld 1 Slightly firmer prices for core services are expected to have a more persistent effect on core inflation.
0,"xbos xfld 1 The Bank anticipates continued solid consumption, supported by accommodative monetary policy and higher federal government transfers, despite weakness in the energy-intensive provinces associated with the impact of the past decline in the terms of trade."
0,xbos xfld 1 Several significant upside and downside risks are present in the inflation outlook for Canada.
0,"xbos xfld 1 The pace of housing starts is expected to pick up in the fourth quarter after three quarters of contraction, supported by strengthening demographic demand."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Although immediate risks have diminished, the policy challenges facing Europe remain considerable and a failure to contain the crisis remains the most serious risk facing the global and Canadian economies."
0,"xbos xfld 1 While the Canadian dollar has not strengthened vis-à-vis the buoyant US dollar, it has risen sharply against overseas currencies."
0,"xbos xfld 1 As markets stabilized during the summer months, the Bank lowered the range for overnight rates on three occasions, to encourage a decline in short-term rates."
0,"xbos xfld 1 In the case of crude oil, this implies that prices would move up from their current level of just under US$60 per barrel to US$65 per barrel by the middle of 2007 and rise gradually to US$67 in 2008."
0,xbos xfld 1 There could be stronger-than-expected momentum in household expenditures in Canada.
0,"xbos xfld 1 The outlook for investment continues to be underpinned by the solid financial positions of Canadian firms, favourable credit conditions and relatively high commodity prices, as well as the impetus to improve productivity in response to heightened pressures to become more competitive."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Real GDP is expected to grow at a rate above that of potential output, starting in the second half of 2016."
0,xbos xfld 1 Economic activity expanded by 2.4 per cent in the first quarter of 2016 but is estimated to have contracted by 1.0 per cent in the second quarter.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Momentum in the emerging-market economies has been buoyed by solid increases in consumption and investment, as well as continuing strength in exports."
0,"xbos xfld 1 The persistent strength of the Canadian dollar and rising unit labour costs will, however, dampen the expansion."
0,xbos xfld 1 Consumer spending picked up after a very weak first quarter.
0,"xbos xfld 1 The Bank's core measure of inflation has remained subdued, fluctuating within a narrow range and averaging about 1.2 per cent since the latter part of 2012."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Many euro-area sovereigns are facing rising funding costs, and European banks have experienced severe funding pressures and increased costs to insure against default risk, owing to concerns about their exposures to the sovereign debt of euro-area peripheral countries."

0,xbos xfld 1 The outlook is therefore highly uncertain and is contingent on political willingness to address the impending fiscal cliff.
0,"xbos xfld 1 In contrast, strong world demand has led to firmness in metals prices."
0,"xbos xfld 1 In a number of emerging markets, including China and India, some fuel prices are regulated, which means the economic benefits of lower prices arise in part through improved government finances."

0,"xbos xfld 1 Although some EMEs have entered 2013 with solid momentum, there is still significant regional differentiation."
0,"xbos xfld 1 With higher interest rates, debt-service costs are expected to increase, thus dampening consumption growth, particularly of durable goods, which have been a significant driver of spending in recent quarters."
0,"xbos xfld 1 As a result, base metals prices are expected to remain weak over the near term, before firming modestly with the projected strengthening in global activity."
0,xbos xfld 1 These yields continue to be affected by the relatively small issuance of long-term government bonds.
0,"xbos xfld 1 With exceptionally stimulative financing conditions, borrowing could grow faster than income."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Against this backdrop, the Bank of Canada kept its key policy rate unchanged at 3 per cent on 10 June and on 15 July, and judges that the current level of the target for the overnight rate remains appropriate."
0,"xbos xfld 1 The investment cuts are expected to diminish toward the end of 2016, leaving investment in the oil and gas sector about 60 per cent below its level in 2014."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Real GDP fell by 5.4 per cent (at annual rates), the largest quarterly drop since 1991, and real gross domestic income continued to fall sharply, owing to a further deterioration in the terms of trade."
0,"xbos xfld 1 The contribution of government spending to real GDP growth is expected to be quite modest over the projection horizon, in line with the fiscal plans of federal and provincial governments to consolidate spending, as outlined in recent budget statements."
0,xbos xfld 1 Recent private sector forecasts suggest that total demand (in volume terms) will expand by about 2 per cent in 1995.
0,"xbos xfld 1 In the first quarter, every member experienced positive growth, which was the second time this happened in the past year."
0,"xbos xfld 1 So far, the price effects have been largely restricted to air fares and local transportation costs."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Despite this positive surprise, the US recovery is expected to proceed at a more modest pace through 2012-13, with GDP growth averaging roughly 2 per cent per year, owing to headwinds from household deleveraging, fiscal consolidation and spillover effects from the European crisis."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Most recently, global corporate and financial market developments have been adversely affecting investor confidence, resulting in rising risk premiums and falling equity prices."
0,xbos xfld 1 The Chinese economy has performed more strongly than expected in January.
0,"xbos xfld 1 In the United Kingdom and in the euro area, the ongoing correction in the housing sector will also reduce household and business spending."
0,"xbos xfld 1 At the same time, subdued foreign demand and persistent competitiveness challenges are restraining the pace of export growth."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Economic and financial developments have been somewhat more favourable than expected at the time of the July Monetary Policy Report, although significant fragilities remain."
0,"xbos xfld 1 The data also show a rise of 5 per cent in hourly labour compensation over the past year, and - after productivity gains are taken into account - a 3.5 per cent rise in unit labour costs in the year ending in the fourth quarter of 2005."
0,"xbos xfld 1 In the Bank's spring Business Outlook Survey, the percentage of firms reporting that they would have difficulty in meeting an unanticipated increase in demand has fallen sharply from recent highs to the average level for the survey."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Nevertheless, the measured rate of capacity utilization in the non-farm goods-producing sector in the third quarter was at its highest level since 1987-88, another indication that the Canadian economy may be approaching full capacity."
0,"xbos xfld 1 With tight supplies and considerable uncertainty about demand, commodity prices are expected to remain volatile for some time."
0,"xbos xfld 1 While import growth is expected to stay robust over the projection period, the outlook for Canadian exports has been marked down, reflecting the weaker US economic outlook."
0,xbos xfld 1 This exerts a drag on US GDP growth of roughly 1 percentage point in 2012 and 1.7 percentage points in 2013.
0,xbos xfld 1 Canadian monetary policy facilitates the adjustment process by aiming to keep inflation at its 2 per cent target and the economy operating near its production capacity.
0,"xbos xfld 1 However, this is expected to be offset by the softness of resales, which should recover only gradually from the contraction at the beginning of the year."
0,xbos xfld 1 This should not be taken as a precise estimate of the expected rate of inflation because the yield spread is also affected by differences in secondary market liquidity and by the shifting portfolio needs and preferences of investors.
0,"xbos xfld 1 On balance, the Bank judges that the economy was operating at roughly half a per cent below its production capacity in the first quarter of 2012, a smaller degree of slack than had been anticipated in the January Report."
0,"xbos xfld 1 On balance, the Bank judges that the economy was operating at about 1 1/4 per cent below its production capacity in the third quarter of 2011, a substantially larger degree of slack than the Bank had anticipated in July."
0,xbos xfld 1 Household credit continues to be readily available at near-record low rates.
0,xbos xfld 1 This decline is mainly tied to falling energy prices stemming from lower prices for crude oil.
0,xbos xfld 1 De-stocking also continued during the second quarter.
0,xbos xfld 1 This uncertainty is likely to weigh on the decisions of businesses and households for some time to come.
0,"xbos xfld 1 The projection for total CPI inflation has also been revised down, reflecting a lower profile for world energy prices, as well as modestly weaker core inflation."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Nevertheless, the differential does not suggest any marked change in long-run inflation expectations since the November Report."
0,"xbos xfld 1 In addition, the debt-ceiling debate has exacerbated the adverse impact on confidence and economic activity."
0,"xbos xfld 1 With its conditional commitment introduced in April 2009, the Bank also provided exceptional guidance on the likely path of its target rate."
0,xbos xfld 1 Estimates of the Bank's conventional measures of potential output and the output gap suggest that the economy is operating very close to full production capacity.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Prices for non-energy commodities are projected to decrease by about 10 per cent between the fourth quarter of 2008 and the end of 2010, somewhat more than previously expected, reflecting softer demand for commodities as the global economy slows."
0,"xbos xfld 1 The proportion of firms reporting labour shortages declined further in the latest survey, remaining below the survey average."
0,"xbos xfld 1 New construction is forecast to contribute positively, particularly in Ontario, where housing demand has been outpacing supply."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Nonetheless, evidence from the Bank's surveys confirms that companies are adjusting to changing economic conditions."
0,"xbos xfld 1 As economic slack is reduced and labour markets firm, inflation rates in these economies are projected to move up gradually."
0,"xbos xfld 1 This decline in total CPI inflation was smaller than anticipated in the April Report, however, since core inflation remained roughly unchanged at 1.9 per cent."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Recent indicators suggest that Canada's labour market has stopped deteriorating, consistent with the resumption of GDP growth."
0,"xbos xfld 1 However, the likelihood of that risk materializing has decreased."
0,"xbos xfld 1 While the timing and magnitude of the benefits of the depreciation differ across industries, several categories of goods exports that are more sensitive to the exchange rate are showing positive momentum."
0,xbos xfld 1 Regulatory measures implemented in recent months are expected to moderate the growth of household credit somewhat.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Annual GDP growth is expected to be 3.1 per cent this year and 2.9 per cent in 2007, keeping the economy close to its production capacity."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Business investment growth remained robust, supported by, but not limited to, the ongoing recovery in energy investment."
0,xbos xfld 1 Firms most often cited physical bottlenecks as the main obstacle to scaling up their production.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Real GDP is expected to rebound in the second half of the year as the impact of the oil price shock on growth in the oil and gas sectors moderates and the rest of the economy strengthens, supported by previous monetary policy easing and the lower value of the Canadian dollar."
0,"xbos xfld 1 The near-term outlook for inflation has been revised up, reflecting firmer-than-assumed oil prices."
0,"xbos xfld 1 These decisions were judged to be consistent with keeping inflation close to the inflation-control target rate of 2 per cent over the medium term, thereby contributing to sustained economic and employment growth in Canada."
0,"xbos xfld 1 The US economy grew at a modest pace in the first half of 2008, owing to further sharp declines in residential investment and weak household spending on durable goods, especially automobiles."
0,"xbos xfld 1 On its own, uncertainty associated with the estimate of the output gap at the start of the projection implies considerable uncertainty about the timing of the return of economic activity to full potential."
0,xbos xfld 1 The broader effects of the past deterioration of the terms of trade on real incomes and wealth will likely be an ongoing constraint on the growth of economic activity through 2017.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Despite this flattening, the yield curve continues to have a moderate positive slope."
0,xbos xfld 1 Net exports exerted a substantial and larger-than-expected drag on growth.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Overall, global economic growth is expected to rise from 2.9 per cent in 2013 to 3.4 per cent in 2014 and 3.7 per cent in 2015."
0,xbos xfld 1 The improved competitiveness of Canadian producers contributed to some substitution of domestic production for imports.
0,xbos xfld 1 Several indicators are consistent with the view that slack has developed since early 2003.
0,xbos xfld 1 The effect of the energy price increases on the level of the core CPI is estimated to have been less than 0.2 per cent since the end of 1998 and less than 0.1 per cent over the past year.
0,xbos xfld 1 The unexpectedly sharp downturn in US capital expenditures and a significant easing in economic growth outside North America have been key negative factors for the Canadian economy.
0,"xbos xfld 1 In many advanced economies where policy interest rates were constrained by their effective lower bounds, central banks have relied on unconventional tools, including quantitative easing and forward guidance."
0,xbos xfld 1 The Canadian dollar was essentially unchanged against most other major currencies over this period.
0,"xbos xfld 1 However, there is evidence that aggregate supply in recent years has been lower than previously estimated because of a reduction in the trend rate of labour force participation."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Based on the past dispersion of private sector forecasts, US economic growth in 2014 would be expected to fall within ± 0.5 percentage points of the Bank's projection, with a somewhat wider range in 2015."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Second, since the recent trend in labour productivity has been lower than expected, the assumption for growth in production capacity from 2006 to 2008 has been revised down to 2.8 per cent."
0,xbos xfld 1 Growth in net exports is expected to benefit from further improvements in US cost competitiveness and an anticipated rebalancing of GDP growth in the emerging-market economies toward increased domestic demand and higher imports.
0,xbos xfld 1 US business fixed investment slowed markedly through the first three quarters of 2012 as a result of the heightened uncertainty associated with the fiscal outlook.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Monetary policy is expected to remain highly accommodative, however, and US financial conditions are very stimulative."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Yield spreads between Canadian and US government securities turned positive for maturities of 2 to 30 years in late 2000, and subsequently widened out."
0,"xbos xfld 1 These decisions were taken against the backdrop of persistently high inflation rates, the expectation that Canadian economic activity would remain near potential, and the stimulative stance of monetary policy."
0,xbos xfld 1 Other measures of the trend rate of inflation that the Bank follows closely have also fallen and in February were close to the core rate.
0,"xbos xfld 1 With a larger and more persistent amount of excess supply in the economy than projected in July, the return to target is now expected to take place somewhat later than previously anticipated."
0,xbos xfld 1 Falling commodity prices resulted in declines in the prices of most manufactured intermediate goods.
0,xbos xfld 1 The expected pickup in global economic growth should lead to further gains in the US-dollar price of non-energy commodities during 2004.
0,xbos xfld 1 The Bank's conventional measures of potential output and the output gap indicate that the level of economic activity was near full capacity in the first quarter of 2003 and fell below full capacity in the second quarter.
0,xbos xfld 1 The July Consensus Economics forecast for total CPI inflation in 2010 was 1.9 per cent.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Investor demand for risky assets is buoyant, reflecting expectations of an improving global economy, as well as the low level of government bond yields."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Once again, this resulted mainly from substantial increases in energy prices at the consumer level."

0,"xbos xfld 1 But with the projected subsequent strengthening of US growth, Canada's exports should pick up over the remainder of the projection period."
0,"xbos xfld 1 These factors include the lagged effects of the surge in sales of existing homes in the fourth quarter of last year, as well as some pulling forward of activity related to changes to mortgage insurance regulations."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Subsequently, some Latin American economies came under financial pressure."
0,"xbos xfld 1 In contrast, household expenditures grew moderately, underpinned by gains in personal disposable income and increased household borrowing."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Housing investment, after another substantial gain in 2006, is projected to decline slightly in 2007 and 2008."
0,xbos xfld 1 A faster-than-expected turnaround in the inventory cycle also provided a considerable boost to overall GDP growth.
0,"xbos xfld 1 In the euro area, despite a strengthening and broadening of growth following progress in deleveraging, inflation has continued to decline, and inflation expectations have shifted down significantly."
0,xbos xfld 1 High and variable energy prices associated with the strength of global demand have kept total CPI inflation above the Bank's 2 per cent target.
0,"xbos xfld 1 In the United States, diminished household confidence, tighter financial conditions and increased fiscal drag are expected to result in weak real GDP growth through the first half of 2012, before growth strengthens gradually thereafter."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Largely reflecting temporary strength at the start of the year, real GDP is anticipated to expand by 2.6 per cent in 2017, before slowing to 1.9 per cent in 2018 and 1.8 per cent in 2019."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Elevated commodity prices, in contrast, should strengthen the current account balances of commodity-producing countries, which, as a group, already enjoy a large current account surplus."
0,"xbos xfld 1 The Canadian economy continues to operate just above its full production capacity, and the near-term outlook for core inflation has moved slightly higher."
0,xbos xfld 1 The economic outlook has been revised up since January to reflect the positive implications of stronger potential output growth and recently tabled federal and provincial budgets.
0,"xbos xfld 1 The adverse feedback loop between weakening economic activity and sovereign and banking sector vulnerabilities has intensified, rendering the task of fiscal consolidation even more challenging."
0,"xbos xfld 1 This outlook incorporates larger monthly increases in the seasonally adjusted core CPI relative to those experienced in the first eight months of 2004, because recent price discounting for such items as clothing and non-shelter services is expected to moderate, and annual increases for tuition fees and property taxes are anticipated."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Inflation has remained low, the domestic economy has begun to respond to the substantial degree of monetary ease in place, and the external economic environment has been favourable."
0,"xbos xfld 1 A slow rotation of demand away from exports and toward consumption is forecast over the projection horizon, facilitated by the government's announced plan to boost household spending and by a very modest appreciation of the real effective exchange rate."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Thus far, their losses have been limited, and their exposure to structured products backed by subprime mortgages quite manageable."
0,"xbos xfld 1 The spread between West Texas Intermediate and Brent prices is projected to narrow from about US$16 in the second quarter of 2012 to around US$7 by the end of 2014, as additions to the pipeline network are expected to contribute to a partial resolution of oversupply conditions in the US Midwest."
0,xbos xfld 1 Regional divergences are evident as energy firms continue to adjust their employment in response to lower oil prices.
0,"xbos xfld 1 It is assumed in the base-case projection that only a small fraction of this US-dollar depreciation will be against the Canadian dollar, and will occur late in the projection period."
0,xbos xfld 1 The expected re-emergence of a modest degree of excess supply in the economy this year should contribute to some downward pressure on core inflation over the remainder of 2001.

0,"xbos xfld 1 In particular, the fundamental supply/demand factors that drive inflation must be distinguished from transitory factors."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Broad-based declines in residential investment and house prices, coupled with tighter credit conditions and waning consumer confidence in the face of high gasoline prices and a softening labour market, contributed to the marked slowdown in consumer spending."
0,"xbos xfld 1 At the same time, there is a marked divergence in economic performance among the G-7 countries."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Decreases in the prices of many import-intensive goods continued to exert downward pressure on the core rate, reflecting the combined effect of declines in the world prices of many manufactured goods and the past appreciation of the Canadian dollar."
0,"xbos xfld 1 By convention, the Canadian dollar is assumed to remain at its recent level of 91 cents US over the projection horizon."
0,"xbos xfld 1 However, the increase in mortgage rates in recent months should exert a slight dampening effect on residential investment over coming quarters."
0,"xbos xfld 1 In any event, the differential between nominal and real rates remains generally in line with the Bank's objective of low inflation."
0,"xbos xfld 1 These developments, combined with recent declines in commodity prices, are expected to dampen global inflationary pressures."
0,"xbos xfld 1 The European Central Bank has signalled that the current asset purchase program could be expanded, if necessary."
0,"xbos xfld 1 The recovery in net exports is expected to remain weak, although the Bank continues to anticipate some improvement over the projection horizon."
0,xbos xfld 1 The Bank judges that the economy is now operating further above its production potential than was projected at the time of the April Report.
0,"xbos xfld 1 However, none of the measures of core inflation, including CPIX, can perfectly capture underlying inflation at any given time."
0,"xbos xfld 1 The Bank judges that the risks are roughly balanced around its revised base-case projection for inflation in Canada - a base case that now incorporates the recent intensification of the global financial crisis, a mild global recession, and the measures that have been taken to resolve the crisis."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Relative to the April projection, growth in household spending is now projected to be slightly firmer, reflecting higher household income, and net exports to be slightly weaker, reflecting more subdued US activity."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Responding to the sustained strength of their economies, several central banks, including the Bank of England, the European Central Bank, and the Bank of Japan, have continued to raise their policy rates since the beginning of the year."
0,"xbos xfld 1 The measure has recovered only 60 per cent of the decline recorded during the 2008-09 recession, owing largely to protracted weakness in the US housing sector."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Total CPI inflation is also projected to decline in the near term to close to 2 per cent, in part reflecting lower core inflation, and to remain around the target over the balance of the projection horizon."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Following a robust first quarter, US economic activity slowed markedly in the second quarter of this year, but available indicators suggest a rebound in the third quarter."
0,"xbos xfld 1 The Bank's base-case economic scenario reflects the fiscal measures announced since the October Report, notably the increase in expenditures contained in the Alberta budget and changes to federal marginal income tax rates introduced at the beginning of 2016."
0,"xbos xfld 1 The decline in exports intensified, reflecting the steep drop in US demand and low commodity prices."
0,xbos xfld 1 This increase in bond rates has also affected the mortgage market.
0,"xbos xfld 1 While this range for the output gap reflects the significant uncertainty surrounding any point estimate, the Bank is building the base-case economic projection using the midpoint of the range (i.e., 1.5 per cent)."
0,"xbos xfld 1 In contrast, the yield curve for Canadian corporate bonds, which has been less affected by unusual supply factors, and which is indicative of the cost of borrowing in the private sector, has a normal positive slope."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Monetary policy easing by a number of central banks, together with the positive effects of low oil prices, is providing support for this pickup in growth."
0,xbos xfld 1 Another important factor in overall cost control has been productivity gains.
0,xbos xfld 1 The outlook for economic growth in the euro area has strengthened in recent months.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Global financial conditions have improved, supported by aggressive policy actions of major central banks, but sentiment remains fragile."
0,"xbos xfld 1 In this context, inflation is projected to increase to close to 2 per cent over the course of 2018 and to remain around 2 per cent until the end of 2019."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Growth of household credit has continued to slow and is now below the growth rate of household income; as a result, the ratio of household debt to disposable income is edging down."
0,"xbos xfld 1 As well, the ongoing strength in the US labour market and the creation of new businesses may draw discouraged workers back into the labour force."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Investment spending in this sector could be even weaker based on experience during the oil-price decline witnessed in 1986, which was similar in magnitude to the current episode."
0,xbos xfld 1 Solid growth in consumer spending should be sustained by advances in real incomes.
0,"xbos xfld 1 These two offsetting factors are projected to diminish in tandem over the projection period, with the result that the core rate should stay at 2 per cent."
0,"xbos xfld 1 While the economy had more momentum than anticipated in the second half of 2011, the pace of growth going forward is expected to be more modest than previously envisaged, largely due to the external environment."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Household consumption has remained firm, supported by steady employment gains in the services sector."
0,"xbos xfld 1 The outlook for consumption in 2018 has been revised up in the base-case projection, because recent data have suggested stronger underlying momentum."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Reflecting these measures, as well as lower oil prices and a weaker yen, the outlook for economic growth in Japan in 2016 has been revised upward, although it remains modest."
0,"xbos xfld 1 While some price declines can be attributed to temporary factors, declining lumber prices most likely resulted from slower-than-expected growth in US construction."
0,"xbos xfld 1 This reflects two important factors: first, the reversal of capital inflows from investors seeking the safe haven of US government securities; and second, the unexpected strength of the US economy in the fourth quarter of 1998 and the first quarter of 1999."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Consequently, there is only a slight drag to growth coming from net exports."
0,"xbos xfld 1 The most important of these unexpected developments was the degree of weakness in the prices of many durable and semi-durable goods, such as automobiles and clothing."
0,xbos xfld 1 A weaker recovery of exports would translate into slower growth in business investment.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Given higher overall debt levels, such spending is expected to be more sensitive to interest rate changes than in previous cycles (see the Appendix for a description of recent changes to the modelling of household consumption and debt)."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Although the strengthening trend has taken hold less rapidly in Germany and Italy, the pace of activity in the euro area should continue to pick up, supported by improving consumer and business confidence."
0,"xbos xfld 1 In particular, the price of lumber fell considerably, partly because US operators were using up stocks built up prior to confirmation by the US government of duties on softwood lumber."
0,"xbos xfld 1 However, total business fixed investment rose during the fourth quarter for the first time in two years and is likely to have risen further in the first quarter of this year."
0,"xbos xfld 1 The strength of demand in China helped raise the prices of base metals, while both livestock and pulp prices have recovered in the face of reduced supplies."
0,xbos xfld 1 Futures prices for crude oil are also higher than those in the January Update.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Growth in resource-related activity is resuming in the wake of significant adjustments to past declines in commodity prices, helping to support a modest expansion of the goods sector."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Still, valuations in some segments of the housing market remain stretched."
0,xbos xfld 1 Other measures of the trend rate of inflation that the Bank follows were also below the 2 per cent target.
0,"xbos xfld 1 In 1999, housing prices moved up noticeably, but there are some indications that activity in the housing market may be easing, partly in response to the increase in interest rates that has taken place since November 1999."
0,"xbos xfld 1 If, however, there was continued weakness in consumer and business confidence, this could translate into lower spending and delayed recovery."
0,xbos xfld 1 The rate of increase of the gross domestic product deflator averaged 0.3 per cent during 1994.
0,xbos xfld 1 Market-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations remain consistent with the 2 per cent inflation-control target.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Fan charts, which are derived using statistical analysis of the Bank's forecast errors, provide a complementary perspective."
0,xbos xfld 1 The Bank judges the following risks to be roughly balanced over the projection horizon.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Nevertheless, past declines in investment in the oil and gas sector and competitiveness challenges in the mining sector will limit their contribution to overall export growth."
0,"xbos xfld 1 In its conduct of monetary policy at low interest rates, the Bank retains considerable flexibility, consistent with the framework outlined in the April Report."
0,"xbos xfld 1 In China, growth slowed to its weakest pace since 2009."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Although the Bank still sees a rebound in the growth of real GDP, economic activity in Canada is expected to be more restrained than projected in the October Report."
0,"xbos xfld 1 With inflation well below the recently announced goal of 1 per cent, the Bank of Japan decided to increase the size of its Asset Purchase Program by ¥10 trillion, or about 2 per cent of GDP, through government bond purchases."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Both total CPI and core inflation have hovered near 2 per cent in recent quarters, about 1 percentage point higher than a year earlier."
0,"xbos xfld 1 This, in turn, reflects uncertainty about the impact of further technological advances, demand and the cost of capital."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Longer-term inflation expectations reported in the surveys have also fallen into line with the midpoint of the inflation-control target range, indicating the growing credibility of monetary policy."
0,"xbos xfld 1 However, the fact that core inflation is soft and has also drifted down recently in some advanced economies, despite diminishing economic slack, requires further analysis."
0,"xbos xfld 1 In its conduct of monetary policy at low interest rates, the Bank retains considerable flexibility, consistent with the framework outlined in the April 2009 Monetary Policy Report."
0,xbos xfld 1 The Bank expects real GDP growth to resume in the third quarter.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Recent housing market developments, particularly in Vancouver and Toronto and adjacent areas have exacerbated vulnerabilities in the household sector, increasing the likelihood and severity of a retrenchment in consumption should a house price correction occur."
0,xbos xfld 1 Strength in national indicators is being driven primarily by elevated activity in two markets - Greater Toronto and Vancouver.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Growth in real GDP is forecast to have slowed sharply in the second quarter, to around 1.0 per cent."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Through 2007 and beyond, risks are tilted to the downside."
0,xbos xfld 1 The supply factors affecting bond markets have made it difficult to extract reliable information from this measure.
0,"xbos xfld 1 In the regular survey reported in the Conference Board's spring Index of Business Confidence, 53 per cent of respondents reported that they expect prices, in general, will increase over the next six months at a rate of 2 per cent or less, and 92 per cent expected a rate of 3 per cent or less."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Very recently, global oil prices have fallen back toward levels assumed in the April Report, driven by uncertainty regarding developments in Greece and Chinese equity markets, ongoing excess supply, and the prospect of additional Iranian oil exports returning to the market."
0,"xbos xfld 1 In addition, results from the summer Business Outlook Survey indicate that the percentage of firms facing labour shortages has risen only modestly from the trough reached in the fourth quarter of 2009."
0,xbos xfld 1 The Canada/US exchange rate fluctuated in a range of 67.50 to 68.50 US cents from mid-November to mid-December.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Total inflation is expected to remain around 1 per cent in the near term before rising gradually, along with core inflation, to the 2 per cent target in the second half of 2014 as the economy returns to full capacity and inflation expectations remain well anchored."
0,"xbos xfld 1 However, in the absence of further appropriate policy actions, there remains a possibility of a disorderly resolution of these imbalances."
0,"xbos xfld 1 For the first quarter of 2017, the anticipated rise in CPI inflation is now somewhat larger than expected at the time of the January Report."
0,xbos xfld 1 Economic forecasts in this environment are subject to a much higher degree of uncertainty than usual.
0,"xbos xfld 1 However, there are signs that the factors that have recently been weighing on investment growth are likely to persist for some time."
0,"xbos xfld 1 As the global recovery, led by the United States, proceeds and downside risks recede, a normalization of interest rates will be both necessary and desirable."
0,"xbos xfld 1 The abrupt easing in the pace of US economic expansion, particularly in the markets for motor vehicles and for information and telecommunications equipment, contributed importantly to a slowing in economic growth in Canada towards the end of last year and into 2001."
0,xbos xfld 1 Business sentiment - particularly among exporters - is also showing tentative signs of improvement.
0,"xbos xfld 1 By convention, the Bank assumes that oil prices will remain near their recent levels."
0,"xbos xfld 1 The Bank's base-case projection incorporates the following key assumptions: a Canada/US exchange rate averaging 98 cents US; energy prices evolving in line with current futures prices; prices for non-energy commodities decreasing by about 15 per cent over the projection horizon; tight global credit conditions persisting through 2008, before gradually improving in 2009; and an orderly resolution of global imbalances."
0,xbos xfld 1 Increases in average hourly earnings of permanent workers are expected to move up somewhat through 2006.
0,"xbos xfld 1 Understanding the reasons behind exchange rate movements is crucial, because they may have different implications for aggregate demand and thus for monetary policy."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Canada's real GDP grew at an annual rate of 1.3 per cent in the third quarter of 2003, somewhat less than had been expected in the October Report."
0,"xbos xfld 1 In India, economic growth has been dragged down by the lingering adverse effects of the currency exchange initiative launched in late 2016 as well as by the transitory costs associated with the introduction of the national goods and services tax in July."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Overall, the Bank expects that growth in Canada will be slow through mid-2012 before picking up as the global economic environment improves, uncertainty dissipates and confidence increases."
0,"xbos xfld 1 The projected path of the Bank's foreign activity measure, which is an indicator of demand for Canadian exports, has been revised down to reflect a less-favourable composition of US economic activity, in particular, weaker business investment."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Another possibility is that technological advances, such as the rise of e-commerce and the digital economy, may be playing a role."
0,"xbos xfld 1 For example, for 10-year bonds, the spreads for A-rated Canadian borrowers over yields on Government of Canada bonds have widened from about 100 basis points to around 140 basis points since the October Report."
0,"xbos xfld 1 Core food prices have also continued to rise markedly, owing to the ongoing surge in the prices of grains and oilseeds."
